Do you sport spectacles? Perhaps you fancy yourself donning a [monocle](http://www.warbyparker.com/monocle), a la Mr. Peanut?

Whether your vision is slightly impaired and you require glasses or you're just trying to pull off geek chic, snag yourself a pair of thick-rimmed glasses this season. Even [The Today Show ](http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26184891/vp/47564064#47564064) recently suggested the accessory as a must-have. An avid glasses-wearer myself (I can't see far away, rendering me hopelessly near-sighted), I fully endorse and support this trend (I'm a Lisa Loeb, cat-eyed or squared glasses gal the past 10+ years). Glasses are an added detail that can _completely_ change a look. Some people may not even recognize you with specs on! A monocle is seemingly all the rage right now, too, believe it or not. Ask [Warby Parker](http://www.warbyparker.com/).

Say goodbye to your wireless-framed eye-wear and embrace the dark, thick frames your inner nerd has always wanted to wear! And if you don't need glasses, you can still pretend you do... non-prescription frames give an otherwise preppy style that extra oomph of geek chic, read: Buddy Holly. I only ask that if you're going to pretend you need glasses, don't wear frames without lenses. This is absurd and a look I can't get behind. Places like [Warby Parker](http://www.warbyparker.com/) and [Moscot](http://www.moscot.com/) house amazing vintage-inspired finds for eye-wear but even [Lenscrafters](http://www.lenscrafters.com/eyeglasses/11/product_trends) has some great options to choose from their "retro cool" collection. Check out this [how to wear nerd glasses](http://simonesmith.hubpages.com/hub/Where-to-Find-How-to-Wear-Nerd-Glasses) article and see what a-dork-able frames fit your persona.

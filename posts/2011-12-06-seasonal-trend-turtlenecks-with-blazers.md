The idea of wearing turtlenecks under blazers might remind you of Ron Burgundy holding a glass of scotch. The key to pulling this look off (without looking like a 70's news anchor) is finding the right textures and colors to match your blazer. [For a more casual look, solid colored turtlenecks with a nice textured pattern (e.g. cable-knit sweaters) pair well with a fitted blazer.](http://lookbook.nu/look/2588163) [![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6NBIKNS72-c/Ts_d_o6gbOI/AAAAAAAAAAc/yc1EhAsOvrw/s320/casual%2Blook.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6NBIKNS72-c/Ts_d_o6gbOI/AAAAAAAAAAc/yc1EhAsOvrw/s1600/casual%2Blook.jpg) For a sleeker look, a cashmere turtleneck will go nicely with a buttoned double-breasted suit jacket, as styled below by Mattias Karlsson.

The fabric you choose, the way it conforms to your body, and the way it frames your face should be considered when dressing in a turtleneck.

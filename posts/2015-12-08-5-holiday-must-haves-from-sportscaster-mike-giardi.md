With the holidays approaching, it's easy to get caught up with all the gift giving that needs to get done. There never seems to be enough to time! That being said, it's also easy to forget about your own wishlist. Check out Boston based sportscaster Mike Giardi's wishlist for inspiration!

1) A purple blazer with a thin lapel, custom done by 9tailors. I like to be bold. I'm not afraid of colors. I want to wear something that no one else is wearing. This would qualify.

2) I want Johnny Hekker's blue suit, only in my size, right on down to the paisley lining (featured on the 9tailors blog). That would absolutely dominate on television.

3) A nice pair of winter dress boots. We do a lot of television from the outdoors and my feet get very cold. I end up wearing bulky boots and I need to step it up. No excuses.

4) I'm in need of a complete changeover with all my dress socks. Getting a little embarrassing. Threadbare in spots. That's not good.

5) A camera. I think I have a pretty good eye but a cellphone camera isn't getting it done. Time to get serious. Lot of good memories are fuzzy, both in my old brain and in my cellphone.The Samsung Galaxy Camera 2 offers its users amazing features that include Bluetooth, WiFi and a large 4.8 inch high-resolution touch screen display. The Galaxy Camera 2 also has a very cool selfie feature that automatically takes five photos and allows you to choose the best one. Perfect for capturing memories during the holidays.

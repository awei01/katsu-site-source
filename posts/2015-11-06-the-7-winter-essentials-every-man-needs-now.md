The temperature is dropping and the days have grown shorter. If you haven't already done so you'll begin prepping for the upcoming winter within the next few weeks. It has been said that men don't need many choices when it comes to their wardrobe, they just need the right ones. When it comes to your wardrobe essentials quality definitely trumps quantity any day. We've compiled a list of seven items that you should make sure you have in your closet this winter.

##### **Winter Essential #1: The Parka**

If this winter is going to be anything like last years a parka is the perfect investment. Find one that is not too cumbersome so that you don' feel like you are taking up double the space everywhere you go. Instead of purchasing yet another black or navy coat opt for a more interesting color. Think military green or burgundy. Both are great ways to add a bit of color into your wardrobe while keeping warm at the same time.

##### **Winter Essential #2: Wool Cardigan**

Layering with sweaters is a no-brainer when the weather is always changing. Every man should have at least one in his wardrobe. Layer them over your dress shirt for work or wear it alone depending on the weather. If you can, grab a few to mix it up. Crew necks and V-necks are a great item to have in rotation.

##### **Winter Essential #3: Chunky Knit Sweater**

Like the wool cardigan a chunky knit sweater is a perfect item for layering. A chunky sweater can be worn in place of a blazer on a warm fall day, layered over a cardigan and dress shirt. Neutral tones are great to have because you can easily pair them with the existing items you already own. Think light grey, ivory, and navy.

##### **Winter Essential #4: Flannel Shirt**

Everybody loves a flannel shirt. They are the perfect shirt for the winter months. Pair them with jeans or chinos, a denim jacket and a pair of boots for a relaxed look. Lighter colored backgrounds are great. However, if you would like to step out the box a bit choose a flannel with a dark background such as burgundy or a charcoal grey.

##### **Winter Essential #5: Hat and Scarf**

Remember to protect your neck and head. They should not be left out as you focus on everything else. You have many options but we would suggest a wool or cashmere to help keep you warm.

##### **Winter Essential #6: Wool Socks**

Socks tend to not get the attention the truly deserve, but when you think about it what would we do without them. You have dress socks that you wear with your shoes for work. However, the winter calls for something a little warmer. Invest in some wool socks that you can wear with your boots. This is also a great place to have fun with patterns.

##### **Winter Essential #7: Dress Boots**

Lastly, let's not forget about your feet. A good pair of boots is essential for the winter months. Of course you wouldn't wear these to trek through the snow, but having them for a night out is great. Make sure you pick up some leather cleaner as well. No one wants salt stains on their brand new boots.

One of our favorite clients, Phil Han, the brains behind [Get Prept,](http://getprept.com/) visited our studio yesterday to do a mini photo shoot. Here's his spin on some of his favorite [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/) shirts:

In addition to being a brilliant entrepreneur, Phil is also a true style-setter in Boston. From casual to dressy, Phil is always manages to look sharp. Phil says, "My sister describes my style as tailored urban prepster which is exactly what I can express with the help of 9tailors."

He continues, "Getting the right fit, colors, textures, and paying a reasonable price is where 9tailors really shines! With these summery shirts it's so simple to go from work-professional to daily casual to a night out on the town. No longer will I be wearing the same shirt as a coworker, gym buddy, or fellow beer drinker, because this shirt... is uniquely mine. "

Thanks for dropping by the studio, Phil! We hope you continue to inspire others.

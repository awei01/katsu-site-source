Did you get engaged over the holiday season, like the celebrity couples above ([Steven Tyler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Tyler), [Matthew  McConaughey](http://www.matthewmcconaughey.com/) or [John Legend](http://www.johnlegend.com/us/home/))? Congratulations!  Like many of these couples, we have no doubt that you have already started thinking about the wedding! The venue? The date? Luckily, for those located in New England, we have really awesome local resources like, [Boston Bridal Lounge](http://www.bostonbridallounge.com/), [Beantown Bride](http://beantownbride.com/) and [Style Me Pretty Massachusetts](http://www.stylemepretty.com/massachusetts-weddings/) to help you find the right vendors.

What can the groom do while the bride is researching florists, fine China and planners? The savvy groom can get started on his own outfit, of course!

Are you eclectic like Steven Tyler? Laid-back like Matthew McConaughey? Or, smooth and sophisticated like John Legend? No matter what your style, we can help you achieve the look that you're going for for your wedding. You don't have to just rent your tuxedo! There are many options. This whole week [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/) will be featuring a few of our favorite weddings of 2011 to inspire you!

Wedding FAQs: **1) How much is a custom designed suit and/or dress shirt? ** A custom suit starts at $490.50 and a custom dress shirt starts at $79. There are various fabric types and collections, which may increase the final price. There is a 15% discount of wedding parties of 3 or more. **2) How long does the whole process take?** We recommend starting no later than 2 months before the big day. While we can turn suits faster than that, we would prefer 2 months to produce the suit around and make any last minute alterations or adjustments. **3) Should I bring my fiance with me to the appointment?** Yes! We definitely recommend bringing your significant other or a responsible member of the wedding party with you. This is particularly important if your fiance has very specific vision of what she or he wants! **4) What should I bring with me to the appointment?** If you bring a swatch of her dress, bridesmaid dresses or table linen, that all helps us to pair colors to together! We also recommend bringing the shoes or any other accessory that you might be wearing to the wedding as well. **5) I am planning to lose/gain weight before the wedding. Will my suit and dress shirt fit? ** If you are planning to lose or gain weight, we will take your measurements during the first fitting. However, we will likely perform the alterations 1 month before the wedding or until you feel like your weight has stabilized. Have other questions about dressing your groom this wedding season?

**How was the weather? Was your wedding indoors/outdoors?**

Everything was indoors except the cocktail hour, which was both indoors and outdoors. The weather was partly to mostly cloudy, with temperatures in the low 70s. There was a chance of rain in the forecast, but the rain held off, and the clouds cleared in the evening. Since we were right around the summer solstice, we actually took our photos after dinner while the band was taking a break. The sun had not yet set and the natural light was spectacular.

**Why did you decide to go with 9tailors on your own custom design?**

We had been given a recommendation and we got a deal through Gilt City. We had always wanted to go with custom suits, but the cost had been preventative until we found the Gilt deal. We had wanted light tan color suits but did not have any luck finding the right suit off-the-rack, and most other custom options were far too expensive.

**Describe your 9tailors experience and items.**

We had a great experience. We had a pretty clear vision from the start, so the 9tailors team mostly made some minor suggestions but certainly provided solid guidance on what details would be worth the extra cost. It was nice to have flexibility with groomsmen choosing their own "add ons." We decided on three-piece suits (the vests were a gift from the groom) in a lightweight Italian wool. The color was between ivory and light khaki - almost like cookie dough. We got custom patterned linings/piping and horn buttons to add some flair.

**What was the best part of your wedding day?**

The ceremony - everything came together wonderfully: the setting was exactly what we had pictured, the minister did a great job, the readings and music were phenomenal... it all just felt right.

**What is your advice to other wedding couples thinking about designing custom suits or shirts?**

The process can be great, but it is best if you have some ideas of your own before you start. Find some pictures of the look that you are going for. Get the details before you make any decisions: the timeline for fitting/ordering/alterations, and the specifics of the costs - and be sure to pass these details along to the bridal party with good communication. Be sure to be cost-conscious because even if you think it is a great outfit, bridal party members may have different tastes, and they are already going to be spending a lot of money on your bachelor party, wedding accommodations, gift, etc.

**Choose your favorite photo and tell us why.**

We love the photo of the entire bridal party on the covered bridge because everyone is together and the colors and style really pop out against the dark rustic background. This is clearly a group of happy people having a great time on a beautiful day in Vermont.

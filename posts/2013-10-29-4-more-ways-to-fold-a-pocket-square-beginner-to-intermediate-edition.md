The importance of the pocket square is often underestimated and unappreciated. Suits became appreciated with the rise of Mad Men but alas, the pocket square is not always in its company. Justin Timberlake aided the revitalization of being a dapper gentleman with his vests over button downs as casual wear and fedora hats. With the glimpse of dressing dapper, his style has evolved into a sleek sophistication with bow ties and pocket squares.

For those of you who watch _How I Met Your Mother_, you understand the importance of a good clean suit guided by Barney. Neil Patrick Harris keeps his suit subtle and clean but breaks up the blue in his shirt and suit with a clean line of a pocket square so not to be overwhelmed with a little spunk with dots on his tie. The folds below are arranged in order from the beginner to intermediate folding levels.

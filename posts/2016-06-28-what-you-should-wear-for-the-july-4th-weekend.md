July 4th is right around the corner. Are you struggling to figure out what you're going to wear? Sometimes you need a little help. That's where we come in. Take a look at what we've put together and put your own spin on things. [![july 4th](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/july-4th.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/july-4th.jpg)   **Your Shirt:** 100% cotton is your best bet. Cotton will keep you cool especially if you'll be manning the grille or spending the day at the beach. Opt for denim or a red gingham. Both are classic colors and red is right on trend for the 4th. **Your Outer Layer:** Depending on where you'll be spending the holiday the night time air can get a bit chilly. Keep it in the trunk of your car or carry it with you. There's no need to unpack your bulky knits from the winter, a cardigan will do the trick. Keep the color neutral so you aren't adding another color into the mix. **Your Shorts:** Denim pairs well with anything. It is a bit heavier than a linen short, but who really wants to be a wrinkled mess all day long? A medium wash will work great with a light blue chambray or your festive red white and blue shirt. **Your Shoes:** Going for a more casual look? Trainers are a great choice in either navy or black. If you want to go for a slightly dressier look suede oxfords are a good choice. Grey, tan or brown will pair well with the denim. Remember no one likes it when their socks are visible with their oxfords. No show socks are a great investment especially for the summer. **Your Watch: **Keep it classic with black or brown or choose a fun pop of color. We prefer a leather band but metal is also a good choice. **Your Belt:** Keep the color neutral. Choose between black or brown. Super bright colors can read a bit too childish. **Your Sunglasses:** Have some fun with your accessories. A pop of red in a classic shape will pull your look together perfectly without seeming gimmicky. Think an aviator in a bright red or a darker maroon color.

What’s new at 9tailors?  Our loft interior recently got a boost! By just adding some wallpaper and props, we transformed an empty corner, into our now one-of-a-kind selfie wall! You can now drop in and snap a quick pic whenever you’re due for an appointment or fitting. Show off your snazzy new suit, or take a group selfie with the friends and family you bring along.   [![7e30a955-bbc4-4090-a138-394802a44e57](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/2016/02/7e30a955-bbc4-4090-a138-394802a44e57.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/2016/02/7e30a955-bbc4-4090-a138-394802a44e57.jpg)  Complete with our beloved menswear mannequin Henrique, our decorated nook is the perfect photo op!    ** Tag us in your selfies @9tailors on Instagram.**

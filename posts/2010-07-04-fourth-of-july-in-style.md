**4 Fun Fourth of July Tips** Happy Fourth of July! We at 9tailors hope everyone has a relaxing and fun holiday weekend. To commemorate this festive weekend of family, friends, and fireworks, here are four easy ways to add to a Fourth of July wardrobe (without wearing a shirt with embroidered fireworks on it or dressed like an American flag from head to toe): 1\. Add a pin. Decorative pins, especially nature and floral themes, are especially popular this season. 2\. Wear a scarf. Add a summer scarf for a fun accent to complete a summer look. 3\. Wear polka dots. A single item (ie. dress or blouse) can give your outfit a retro, yet fun holiday vibe without being overwhelming. 4\. Wear big jewelry. The easiest way to dress up an outfit, with virtually any colors, is by adding a single item of fun jewelry; be it a necklace or bangles.

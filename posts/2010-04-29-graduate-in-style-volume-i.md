Congratulations, graduate!

For those of you who will soon be starting your new job as an investment banker, consultant, or marketing analyst, etc., it is likely that those comfy sweats won't fly, even if it did for class (darn!). 

Here are some step-by-step pointers for transitioning a wardrobe from college-chic to young professional. 

**Step 1:** Take stock of your wardrobe. Is it mostly gym wear and flip flops? Did you collect some decent button downs or blouses over the years? Make a mental note of what you've got.

**Step 2:** Try on what you found. Does it fit? Does it drape nicely? Is it a relevant fabric and cut? Is it clean? If something needs to be dry-cleaned or altered, do it. You'll never wear something if a hem is slightly too long or if it is sitting in a bottom drawer getting wrinkled.

Take a look at the images below. If that were your wardrobe, what would you keep for workdays and what would be relegated to weekends? 

Next steps coming soon! Keep tuned.

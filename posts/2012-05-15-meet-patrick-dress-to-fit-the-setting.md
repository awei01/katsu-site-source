Whenever Patrick visits the 9tailors studio, the good-natured gent is always clothed well. As he discusses below, he's not one for under-dressing nor over-dressing, but he has a intuitive knack for looking the part and getting it right.

A linen sports coat and cotton pants are must-haves for Spring and Summer: they're lightweight, fashionable, and follow trend without overdoing it. Patrick's light blue blazer has a half self-lining, an option we at [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) especially recommend for summer style. Don't be scared of linen and cotton because they wrinkle easily! And what you see here are separates: we offer full linen and cotton suits in a variety of colors.

**Name:** Patrick Mulready **Age:** 28 **Hometown:** Wethersfield, CT **Current Residence:** Boston, MA **Occupation:** Commercial Property Insurance Underwriter

**How long have you been a 9tailors client?**

2 years

**Why choose custom?**

I don't exactly have the "off the rack" body type. I like to have everything just the right length. I would end up getting everything I bought tailored anyway, so getting things custom-made makes sense for me.

**What/who inspires your style? Why?**

I wouldn't say something or someone specific inspires my style but I like to dress to fit the setting. I generally get ideas in magazines or online. There are definitely certain stores sites that I look at frequently.

**What is your favorite piece from 9tailors?**

I like them all but I probably wear my blue gingham shirt with the pink color inlay the most.

**What would be your style advice to other men in your professional field?** I'm not a big fan of business casual but I understand that it is pretty much the norm now. I would say leave the polo shirts for the golf course and barbeques and wear button-down shirts to the workplace. Always have a blazer or suit coat with you, as well. _Right on._ Take a gander at some other shots of Patrick's photo shoot, courtesy of our wonderful photographer, [Channing Johnson](http://www.channingjohnson.com/).

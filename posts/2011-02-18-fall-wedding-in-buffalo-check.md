Last fall, two amazing Bostonians were married in the Berkshires. When the bride, Liana, (she's also the Managing Editor of the fashion blog, [New Brahmin](http://www.newbrahmin.com/)) approached us about their theme, ideas and vision, we were totally thrilled to be a part of their day. Liana wanted us to make the groom and his wedding party, vests and shirts with buffolo check accents. It's very befitting of their theme: Ralph Lauren Country.

Here are some wonderful shots of the groom, Mike, and his wedding party in our duds. Photos taken by the very talented photographer, Emilie, of [emilie inc.photography.](http://blog.emilieinc.net/2010/10/liana-and-michael-marry-in-berkshires.html)

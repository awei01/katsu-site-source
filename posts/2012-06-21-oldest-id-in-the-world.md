THE MONOGRAM! Usually in the form of initials, people mark their possessions, businesses, clothes, stationary,  luggage, whiskey flasks... you name it, someone has probably monogrammed it. Signature items deserve, well... signatures.

After perusing the interwebs, there is so much historical information about the monogram! Click this Wikipedia [entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monograms) for more information. Did you know:

"Monograms were first used as currency. This was a transition from the barter system to the beginnings of the creation of money. The first monograms appeared on clay coins with the initials of the ruler of the region. Later monograms developed to identify the valuable property of royalty such as silver, gold and other precious metaled goods. These items ranged from weaponry and armor to household items. Royal banners and Coat of Arms also were some of the first monograms in use." \*\*

And if you've ever wondered why the last initial sometimes goes in the middle of the monogram:

"Monograms of the 19th century had the three initials side by side with no overlap. The first and last name initials were a smaller font size than the middle initial. The overlap and initial size rules changed in more contemporary times to reflect a large last name initial and overlapping that created a symbol. The last name initial is also commonly found between the first and middle name initials." \*\*

[9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) offers monogram placement in a variety of colors and fonts. Some grooms do their wedding dates or the name of their betrothed on the inside of their wedding suits, some clients prefer a subtle monogram on the inside collar of their shirts, while others go for a cuff monogram. Wherever you prefer, we are happy to oblige. And if you want to use a nickname or a motto, we encourage you to get as creative as possible, within a certain character limit...

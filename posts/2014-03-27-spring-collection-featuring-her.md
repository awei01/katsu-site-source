Technology is advancing at a greater pace than we have ever thought was _actually_ possible. Sure, we imagined it and expected to go faster if anything given our predictions for what the year 2010 was supposed to look like from movies made in the 1970's and 1980's. But realistically? We can only expect so much to happen at once or really, we can only expect so much to be released on the open market. Otherwise, I think we're catching up to our fantasies and science fiction stories at an alarming rate.

Generations are being raised on i-pads and smart phones. We live on our phones. We are lost if we can't find our phone, forget it at home or god forbid - the battery dies and we don't have a charger with us or even more tormenting, no outlet. We socialize with each other in person while keeping our eyes on our miniature screen and barely put it down; whether it work, social media (not actually socializing with other people, but networking) or just playing candy crush, the large majority of us don't know how to be present.

[Her](http://www.herthemovie.com/#/everything-about-everything) is a beautiful movie by Spike Jonze about socially reconnecting ... with an IOS system. But nonetheless, [Joaquin Pheonix'](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618/?ref_=tt_cl_t1)s character, [Theodore](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/), learns how to love again and how to emotionally reconnect, eventually, with another person and how to get himself out of his own funk.

For the put together guy who finds freedom with technological growth and keeping up to date with the latest gadgets, we give you, ouroutfit inspired by Theodore from _Her_.

A laid back but tailored linen jacket keeps things casual but put together when you're out and about. You may not have to wear a wool suit to the office everyday but you don't want to look like you just rolled out of bed. The colored cotton pants keeps the outfit lively with fun socks to match and play on subtle details, like the purple stripes in your custom shirt. The custom shirt has two chest pockets for your phone (where Theodore keeps his) or business cards, ready for you to connect with anyone at the local coffee shop or wifi bar. The shirt also features a special button down that I have yet to see anywhere else. Photos to follow in a few weeks.

Interested in a casually tailored garment like a blazer or just pants for the warmer seasons? Want to have brighter colors and start exploring away from the ordinary navy's and gray's? Want a different kind of collar like the 'batman' collar or want to even know what a 'batman' collar is and how many different ways we can button down the collar? Contact us at info@9tailors.com!

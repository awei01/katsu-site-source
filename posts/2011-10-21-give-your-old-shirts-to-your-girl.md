Have some nice shirts that are too loose for you now? Or, simply just don't like the fit of your other shirts, but can't bear to part with it? Give the shirts to your girl. She can turn it into a dress or skirt. Watch this awesome video below.

Now that you've given everything in your closet away...you'll probably need new perfect fitting shirts. Contact us at [info@9tailors.com](mailto:info@9tailors.com) for an appointment.

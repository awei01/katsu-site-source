Do you own a bow tie? If you don't, then you should. This timeless fad has come a long way! With all of the varying tie knots out there, this fashionable version will never go out of style. And with so many trendsetters coming to our studio, it was about time we ramp up our accessory selection. That's why we have launched [OoOTie](http://www.oootie.com/) at 9tailors! The founders, Matthew Pearlson, Adrian Rodriguez, and Diego Torres-Palma put a modern twist on the classic item, but their looks are nothing short of extraordinarily hip.

Congratulations, Emily and James!

**What are your names?**

James Darragh and Emily Barrett

**Where and when was the big day?**

Bull Point, private home in Jamestown, RI on June 16, 2012

**How was the weather? Was your wedding indoors/outdoors?**

We lucked out with a picture perfect Rhode Island summer day. Everything took place outside: the lawn ran down to the water's edge, overlooking Narragansett Bay and Newport - it was an amazing backdrop for the wedding.

**Why did you decide to go with 9tailors on your own custom design?**

Our wedding was a labor of love - we hand-made absolutely everything we could, and our personalities came through in the small details. We wanted to put our touch on everything, and 9tailors was the perfect way to do that for James's formal wear. It was a lot of fun to customize the shirt down to the smallest detail. The shirt fit perfectly.

James had his wedding date monogrammed on the shirt's left cuff

**Describe your 9tailors experience and items**

When we heard that 9tailors would be in New York City, we booked an appointment immediately. Samantha was a wonderful consultant - she guided us through the many, many style, color, and pattern options and helped design the perfect shirt. The step-by-step process was easy with her guidance... there were so many ways to customize the small details, and her expertise was spot on. 

**What was the best part of your wedding day?**

Our wedding day was amazing - it was wonderful to celebrate with so many of our favorite people! For us, the ceremony was the best part of the day. It was great to stand up there together, overlooking the water, and to see our family and friends so happy for us. The BBQ dinner was pretty good, too and not even a drop of sauce got on the shirt!

**What is your advice to other wedding couples thinking about designing custom suits or shirts?**

Go for it! A wedding is the perfect occasion to go all-out. 9tailors makes the entire process special and easy. It is especially fun to re-wear the shirt, thinking back on all of the memories of our wedding day. This isn't our last 9tailors custom shirt!

Hey, it's his day, he does what he wants

**Choose your favorite photo and tell us why.**

We had so much fun taking pictures in the photo booth. It was a time to be playful and silly in our formalwear, and we loved seeing all of our guests do the same. We took this picture right before we hit the dance floor - the calm before the storm!

Before the dancing ensued...

Upcoming nuptials? Thinking about designing your own shirt or suit? Garment turnaround time is typically five weeks. We offer rush priority for an additional fee, but we recommend having a consultation at least two months prior to your wedding date (to alleviate your stress and ensure the perfect fit!) Email a style consultant at [{{ site.emails.customerservice }}](mailto:{{ site.emails.customerservice }}) for any questions or to request more information.

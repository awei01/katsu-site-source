Remember these shoes from [Back to the Future II](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096874/)?

Now you can own a pair from [Nike](http://nike.com/).

Pretty awesome, don't you think? While it doesn't lace up up on its own, the shoes are styled very similarly as the originals in the movie. Most importantly, though, the shoes (only 1,500 released by Nike), are being auctioned on [eBay](http://nikemag.ebay.com/?_trksid=p5197.m1256). Proceeds for the 10-day auction will go towards fighting Parkinson's Disease. The [Michael J. Fox Foundation](http://www.michaeljfox.org/?gclid=CLC-vK7HkKsCFYTb4AodAXGFSg) will match all donations up to $50 million. It's pretty pricey right now with current bids ranging from $4500 to $5100+. My recommendation? Bid [now](http://nikemag.ebay.com/shoes).

Good luck!

If you have read the popular novel, [_The Great Gatsby_, by F. Scott Fitzgerald](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/f/fitzgerald/f_scott/gatsby/), then you have probably already reserved your seats for the new movie based on the famous story. The film, set to be released in May 2013, starring the one and only Leonardo DiCaprio, takes place during the Roaring Twenties, post World War I. Narrated by Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate and WWI vet who lives next to the mansion of Jay Gatsby, a millionaire who throws extravagant parties, the book is a timeless classic that any person would enjoy. If you haven't had the chance, we highly recommend you pick up a copy for a good read.

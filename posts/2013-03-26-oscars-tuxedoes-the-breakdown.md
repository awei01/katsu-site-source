Busy season is hitting us full tilt. In preparation for our beloved wedding couples, we are scouring the interwebs for inspirations, trends, looks, and new ideas. As we have already begun working with so many couples who fancy the classic tuxedo, we figured we'd do a little bloggy on it. 

Basic staples of a tuxedo to note:

	* Darker fabric like black or midnight navy, or even a white dinner jacket
	* Satin accoutrements: lapel, pockets, stripe down the pant leg, and satin covered buttons
	* White Tuxedo Shirt with bib front, wing tip collar (or a crisp white dress shirt)
	* Cummer bund or vest
	* Tailcoat or rear-grazing jacket 
	* Single Button jacket with four sleeve buttons
	* Vent and Lapels differ with designers, era, body type, etc, but the most common and most classic options are a shawl lapel and no vent. 

 Those of you looking to tux it up: we've compiled some looks from the star-studded red carpet at this year's Oscars. From the conventional to the updated to the wacky to the inventive, see our photos below for more inspiration on how to individualize your tuxedo look.

MARK ANDREWS

	* Flaunt that Scottish heritage! Kilts are always appropriate with a tuxedo. Mark's jacket also has some grommets on the pocket besom for added flair. 
	* Highly advise socks to match your kilt!
	* Patent Leather Boots

JAMIE FOXX

	* Nowadays, you can liven up your tuxedo with a different hue. Mr. Foxx does it well with grey.

GQ says:

> **No Black Tie** 
> The biggest trend in black tie? No black at all. Designers brought their color wheels to eveningwear this season in a big way, painting tuxedo and dinner jackets in rich midnight navy, jewel tones, and even khaki, as seen at Valentino. The other big news for formal was summer-ready eveningwear that harbors all the old-world glamour guys want in a tuxedo, but is lightweight enough to not leave you in a puddle at the end of the night.

ROBERT DOWNEY JR.

We usually applaud Iron Man for his impeccable taste, but we don't love the monochromatic look with a tuxedo. Try breaking up your colors for your wedding day.

SAMUEL L. JACKSON

Nick Fury looks DOPE in the velvet jacket and contrast lapel trim. When you typically play a badass, you must dress the part. Velvet is very Spring! Did you know we carry it in the 9tailors studio? Read [here.](http://2013/01/lets-talk-velvet.html)

JOSEPH GORDON LEVITT

	* We swoon for JGL, not only because he seems to be in only awesome movies, but his fashion choices are always a hit. This is a very subtle design option that we are seeing more and more.

CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER

	* Continuing with the subtle velvet additions, see how last year's Best Actor Winner sported a full velvet collar. 

 So, there you have it. The tuxedo, in all its traditional glory, as well as Hollywood's embellishments, is the classiest suit you can own. Obviously, we will guide you along the most conventional sartorial rules (we love [The Black Tie Guide](http://www.blacktieguide.com/)). However, it's your wedding and you can do what you want!

Come join us on Thursday, April 22 for "Fashionably Late," an evening of fashion and music at the [Liberty Hotel](http://libertyhotel.com/). [9tailors](http://9tailors.com) has teamed up with [Moxie](http://www.moxieboston.com/), a shoe and accessories boutique in Beacon Hill, to create a fabulous & playful lineup just in time for spring. 

As if this were not enough reason to find yourself fashionably late at the Liberty Hotel on Thursday, the [New England Revolution](http://www.revolutionsoccer.net/team/) soccer players will be impeccably dressed in [9tailors](http://9tailors.com) shirts and mingling with guests throughout the course of the evening. Come and meet them!

No need to put your name on a list or buy a ticket; just show up! Here is how:

**When:** Thursday April 22, 2010

8PM-2AM, doors close at 9PM, Fashion Show by 9tailors and Moxie at 10PM

**Where:** The Liberty Hotel in Beacon Hill, Boston 

**Why:** Because the New England Revolution will be there, because there will be great music by Michael Savant, and most of all because of the fabulous looks presented by 9tailors and Moxie!

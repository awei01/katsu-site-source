## Meet Paul

### Describe your style.

Modern.

### Where do you get your style inspiration?

Mostly from different fashion Instagram blogs.

### What is your favorite 9tailors garment? Tell us why. How do you accessorize your outfit?

My business suit is my favorite. The best accessory is a nice pocket square.

### What advice would you give to someone who is trying custom tailoring for the first time?

Come prepared with a general color and style in mind, or else you might get overwhelmed.

### Why did you choose to shop at 9tailors?

Originally, because of a deal in gilt.com but I stayed because the service was great.

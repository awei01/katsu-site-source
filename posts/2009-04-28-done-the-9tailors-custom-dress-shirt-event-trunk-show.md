This past weekend we had our first (successful!) custom dress shirt event and trunk show. Over 40 people came in to visit us at the [Guilded Boston](http://www.guildedboston.com/) studio on Newbury Street!

Here are some pictures from the event. All photos were taken by the ultra talented [Christian Schlubach.](http://christianschlubach.com/) [![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SgCGxbVfVBI/AAAAAAAAHeg/7xB75nq51kA/s400/wishpot_image_20090505.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SgCGxbVfVBI/AAAAAAAAHeg/7xB75nq51kA/s1600-h/wishpot_image_20090505.jpg)[](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SfdeLeV55_I/AAAAAAAAHcc/ZdHg-5VwW8g/s1600-h/trunk-100.jpg)

The wondrous and amazing thing about Christian's photographs is that he was able to capture our models and products in a seemingly peaceful and tranquil environment. In fact, however, a whirlwind of activity was actually taking place only inches away!

You’ve got your pocket square, tie, tie bar, and watch coordinated with your suit. Then, you make one of the biggest style mistakes you can possibly make: putting on a pair of white athletic or solid black socks. Nothing says bland and boring like a pair of basic socks. But you may be wondering why socks are so important when they often go unseen? Little details make a big difference in an outfit, and socks are one such accessory that will bring your look to the next level. Whether it’s polka dots, stripes, or argyle, a snazzy pair of socks add unexpected flair and overall polish. [![thegistsized](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/thegistsized.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/thegistsized.jpg) Once your pair has passed the above inspection, make sure you have the right sock length for your needs.

*   **Above the calf** adds lots of extra warmth, which is ideal for winter months.
*   **Mid-calf** is best for warmer weather, or those men that don’t want to worry about having to pull their long socks up all day.
*   **Ankle** length gives your ankles some sun with a no-socks look.

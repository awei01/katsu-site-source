Congratulations to Bad Rabbits' bassist, Graham on his beautiful wedding day! With a classic navy three piece glen plaid suit, he looked dashing. Photographed by [Timothy Musho](http://musho.tumblr.com/), the day looked perfect.

_"Our wedding took place in September in the Berkshire mountains in western Massachusetts. It was outdoors at a beautiful bed & breakfast called Race Brook Lodge. It wouldn't make sense to wear a tux or black suit in this setting and I never really pictured that for myself when I thought about our upcoming nuptials. _

_My style has always skewed a bit more towards the vintage, classic, throwback direction. So rather than try and hunt for that type of garment, I thought it would be much more fun and meaningful to have a custom suit built. My first thought was 9 Tailors. I worked with them in 2013 when I performed on Jimmy Kimmel with my band Bad Rabbits and they built us  all amazing custom made suits. They were so attentive to all our requests and details, the suits came out so well and really added a lot to the visual aspect of our performance._

_I was dead set on a 3 piece suit with a subtle pattern and wool or felt texture. 9 Tailors honed it in by giving me tons of color and pattern options, leather buttons and a slim fitting cut. It really gave me the ability to combine all the details I wanted from various other suits I had seen into a truly unique and tailored piece. _

_The day of the wedding I got so many compliments on the suit and my wife and I ended up matching colors pretty perfectly even without seeing each other's outfits. I now wear it to other occasions and still love it just as much." _

[![Graham]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/Graham.jpg)]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/Graham.jpg)We love the option of a three piece suit for a groom. You look dapper with or without the jacket on... perfect for a summer wedding! Once again, congratulations to Graham and Keren on their magical wedding day!

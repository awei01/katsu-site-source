Ah Valentines Day. The day where you are either in a panic in what to get for your significant other or you just use as an excuse to eat chocolates. But what about yourself? Why not treat yourself to a little extra love? Our expert style consultants aide you in achieving the look your going for with the desired colors and details. We ensure your look doesn't go overboard and keeping a balanced overall look.

Start with the basics - White Shirts

A well fitting basic white shirt is something every man should have in his closet. It goes with everything and instantly cleans up your look. Keep it from being too plain by adding touches of color or pattern.

Dress Your Blazer or Suit with a Pocket Square

Don't leave your suit looking bare and naked, bring it to life with a touch of color or pattern. Pocket squares break up full suits, keeping it from looking too plain or overwhelmingly-ordinary. If you are wearing a traditional gray or navy suit, a pocket square is the perfect way to subtly bring your suit to life without wearing a loud tie or shirt. Its the right amount of effort and sophistication that says "[I know what I'm doing](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2013/10/4-more-ways-to-fold-pocket-square.html), [while looking good doing it](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2013/10/4-ways-to-fold-to-pocket-square-peaks.html)".

Mix It Up with Colored and Patterned Shirts

If this is new territory for you, start off with a check or plaid shirt. They are different from the ordinary stripped shirts that you see everywhere and add a little bit more life to it with more color and design. They pair really well with casual blazers or making a suit a bit more fashion forward.

If you're not one for patterns, there's always the solid colored shirts that isn't your traditional blue. Try something bolder or with tiny patterns that aren't noticeable until standing closely by...which is what you want anyways. And don't forget, no one ever looks bad with a bow tie, especially ones with bicycles on it.

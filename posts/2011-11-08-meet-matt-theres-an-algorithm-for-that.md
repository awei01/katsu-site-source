Meet our client of two years, Matt. With a full sleeve of a colored double helix and Twins logo tattooed on his right arm, Matt isn't what comes to mind when you talk about PhD candidates in Chemical Engineering. His edgy style challenges the traditions of academia with a fresh take on classic ideas. He is a master at pulling together separates such as the vest-pant combo above.

When he isn't in the lab Matt is busy with wedding planning. We helped him design a great tux for his wedding this winter, although we can't say much more as it is a surprise reserved for the wedding day.

**Name****:** Matthew D. Stuber **Age**: 27
**Hometown**: Minneapolis, MN
**Currently Residing In**: Cambridge, MA
**Occupation:** Graduate Student (PhD Chemical Engineering)

 **How long have you been a 9tailors client?**

2 years

 **Why choose custom?**

It's obvious that you have to have a cereal-box body to look good in off-the-shelf clothing. I've always been in need of either a custom clothing designer or a REALLY good tailor. Even my trusty Club Monaco has begun to sell "Classic Fit" clothing, which is a fancy way of saying clothing that costs them less to manufacture and will make you look homeless. Going custom is the only way to guarantee my satisfaction**.**

 **What would be your style advice to other men in your professional field?**

Leave your cross-trainers at home and learn to tie a tie. Just because the dress code is business casual doesn't mean you can't step it up and look like a professional. That suit you bought for $50 for "special occasions" makes you look like a 12 year old playing dress-up in daddy's clothes. Where are your hands?

How would you describe your style? Edgy modern twist on 1920's classic (leave out the pleats and 3-button coats). My more casual days are punk prep.

**What/who inspires your style?**
-My grandmother and her traditional values of formal attire and "dressing for success"
-James Bond (specifically [Daniel Craig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Craig))
-[Mercedes AMG](http://www.mercedes-amg.com/): classic luxury with an edgy twist hiding shear madness.
-The idea of being the only person who gets dressed in the morning and possibly being commended for it.

**What is your favorite piece from 9tailors?**

My most heavily worn pieces would include my purple check/white collar shirt and grey vest. Although I haven't worn it yet, I am quite fond of my winter tuxedo.

As any chemist knows, the devil is in the details. Matt's mastery of commanding the smallest components of his ensembles shows. Check out those metal buttons on the pants and vest.

Another detail, that does not go unnoticed, is the contrast fabric on the besoms. This is the same fabric that the pants are made from helping tie the two separates together without having to fully match.

Step-up your look with a vest this season. Works great to dress up jeans and a button-down or to add something interesting to a standard two piece suit.

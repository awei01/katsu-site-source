Here are a few more hints on how to successfully wear a yellow tie!

*   Since it is a patterned tie, make sure to choose carefully when mixing patterns. While you don't have to stick to only solid colors shirts, make sure that:

> *   The shirt pattern is a smaller scale than the tie, or vice versa. (for this tie, we would suggest a shirt with a small-scale pattern)
> 
> *   Since the tie is a bold pattern and color, keep the shirt pattern and color subtle and light.

*   A grey or navy suit will work well with the yellow contrast.

*   Try a shirt with light copper or khaki tones to bring out the copper accents on the tie.

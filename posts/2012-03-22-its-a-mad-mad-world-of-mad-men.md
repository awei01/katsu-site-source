Only a few more days until the two-hour premier of the best show on television, _Mad Men._ 18 months is a long time to wait! Aside from the handsome specimens (men and women alike, hubba hubba) that grace the set of this spectacular series, the intricate wardrobe has caused a welcome resurgence of style over the past few years. Especially in menswear. A style that screams distinguished, classic, timely, sharp, crisp, infinitely cool, and _bad_. Not bad meaning bad but bad meaning _goooooood._ A style every man should emulate (as many male [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) clients do exceptionally  well). Since the beginning of _Mad Men,_ its fashion has been much applauded and praised all over the interwebs. Rightly so! Authenticity is hard to replicate so accurately and precisely. Kudos to the costume designers led by genius [Janie Bryant](http://janiebryant.com/), who nail it every time by conveying character traits through clothing. Let's take a gander at the top five best _Mad Men_ trends, shall we? From Sterling Cooper to Sterling/Cooper/Draper/Pryce! 1.The Slim Fit Suit. It seems more and more of our clients are going for this streamlined, custom look. When you have a suit that fits your proportions, your physique is elongated and slimmed down. While we prefer a single breasted suit, double breasted can also be worn in a more European, sleek style. We 9tailors ladies also recommend a three-piece ensemble...when you take your jacket off, your look is still pulled together by a complementary vest/waistcoat.

2\. Mixed complementary patterns, textures, and tones. There's an [art](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-to-expertly-mix-patterns.html) to how you pair patterns and colors. The trick is to use colors and textures that play off one another.

3\. Sports coat. [GQ](http://www.gq.com/style/wear-it-now/201203/best-spring-sports-jackets-blazers-men-trey-songz) mandates all gentlemen acquire a sports jacket this spring. This element easily dresses up a casual look by adding sartorial sophistication. Don Draper wears one when he's kicking it in Cali while some of the younger creatives at Sterling/Cooper/Draper/Pryce wear it for work.

4\. Accessories. As in the pictures above and below, you'll often spot signature items like a skinny tie, bowtie, a pocket square, tie pins, or a fedora in every episode. Again, you can wear these things casually or formally. Clutch accessories up the notch of coolness.

5\. Tuxedo! It dominated this year's [Oscars](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2012/02/oscars-2012-ode-to-classics.html), proving you just can't go wrong with a classic tuxedo. Everything about it exudes refinement and elegance.

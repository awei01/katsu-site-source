These brightly colored, casual fabrics are perfect for any spring or summer outing. But, what are our best tips to keeping them polished and modern?

**Tip #1: Dress it up (left photo)**

Linen or chambray is a great layering piece. It comes in a variety of shades and is very breathable. Our favorite? Dress shirts in navies and light blues. Pair the linen shirt under your favorite blazer and casually roll up the sleeves. Our linen shirts start at $189.00.

**Tip #2: Go all out (center photo) **

Your next outdoor wedding in the Hamptons, Vineyard or Maine may not be a formal affair. Might we suggest a crinkly seersucker in a fitted style? To keep it modern and stylish, pair the suit with neutral hued accessories. Our seersucker suits start at $775.00.

**Tip #3: Add some pop (right photo) **

After our harsh, white winter, it's hard not to gravitate towards color. If you're a style novice, try neon accessories. If you're a bit more daring, try bright trousers, like kelly green or marigold yellow, in our new microfiber fabrics. These wick away sweat and are virtually wrinkle-resistant. Rugged enough for your next golf outing, yet polished enough for date night.  Our microfiber trousers start at $285.00.

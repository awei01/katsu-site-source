There are several different ways I can help men through personal shopping and styling. One way is a complete overhaul; revamping a closet and an entire wardrobe to better fit his likes, needs, lifestyle and physique. Sort of an "out with the old, in with the new" option.[![](http://ak.buy.com/PI/0/250/220288295.jpg)](http://ak.buy.com/PI/0/250/220288295.jpg)Another service offered, is to help put together outfits using what he already owns while possibly adding a few new key pieces or accessories. I also offer to shop specifically for an item or accessory that he knows he needs but isn't sure of what exactly to buy such as, but not limited to, tie, shoe, or jean shopping. Services range from a complete wardrobe makeover to guidance and suggestions to strict shopping.

**5 things every man should have in his closet:**

[A reversible leather belt](http://www.dillards.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=301&storeId=301&langId=-1&productId=502548274); one side black and the other brown. There's a time and a place for a "worn in", vintage looking belt, but its definitely not with a suit or a crisp pair of dress pants. I suggest reversible because it "[kills two birds with one stone](http://www.saksfifthavenue.com/main/ProductDetail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524444121461&afsrc=1&site_refer=GGLBASE001&ci_src=14110944&ci_sku=ParentItem0415298646839)" and makes it easy to never be stuck with a mismatched look such as a navy suit with a black belt and brown shoes.

They can be worn solo, with a casual suit, or under a leather jacket, blazer, or flannel. I suggest you opt for quality ones and leave the Hanes brand for the flannels and at-home lounging. Among my favorites are LNA and James Perse.Nice outerwear. Whether it be a [rugged leather](http://www.singer22.com/man/ms5bq06f0-db.html), [utility jacket ](http://www.neimanmarcus.com/store/catalog/prod.jhtml?itemId=prod117100028&parentId=cat23690739&masterId=cat14810731&index=47&cmCat=cat000000cat000470cat14120827cat14810731cat23690739) or a [sleek wool dress coat](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/sanyo-microfiber-double-collar-coat/3100769?origin=category&resultback=5275), go-to outerwear is a must. The fit is important as well as the shape, color, and fabric. You should pick something that fits your lifestyle and personality.

A classic single or double breasted suit in grey, black, or navy. Fit, fit, fit is all I can say. If you have the means, the extra cost to purchase a custom suit is well worth it. If you go with a solid or a very subtle pin stripe, it will be easiest to mix and match shirts, ties, and other accessories.A [casual blazer](http://www.neimanmarcus.com/store/catalog/prod.jhtml?itemId=prod117280059&parentId=cat23690739&masterId=cat14810731&index=43&cmCat=) and [cardigan](http://www.neimanmarcus.com/store/catalog/prod.jhtml?itemId=prod121790100&parentId=cat33750735&masterId=cat21150734&index=1&cmCat=cat000000cat000470cat14120827cat21150734cat33750735). Both can be thrown on over a tee or a button up and can be dressed up by adding a tie or scarf as well. They are both good layering pieces to have in your wardrobe and can be utilized year round.

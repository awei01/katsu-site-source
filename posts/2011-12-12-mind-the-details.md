On my most recent trip to New York, while visiting clients at their offices, I noticed something that should not be overlooked . Gentlemen, please don't fall victim to this. I know buying clothes off the rack has a few perks( if only very few) but there are some issues that should be addressed before wearing it in public.

The vents are tacked closed- they are not intended to remain that way. This is done to help the jacket retain the proper shape during the traveling and/or trying on process.

Please, please cut the threads so they may break free and allow themselves to properly flatter your shape rather than making you look larger than you are- not to mention oblivious to details.

See how his vents have been cut loose and can now give the jacket the motion it was intended to have.

Also, the pockets may be done the same way. If you don't feel comfortable removing the threads yourself, alert the dry cleaner and they should be able to help you. Although, especially for women, make sure there is a pocket beneath the stitching. Do not be fooled by faux pockets and end up with a hole in you trousers or jacket.

The devil is in the details. Make sure you look as polished as possible when donning your suit. It can be the difference between dashing and disheveled. Set up an appointment today to make sure your come across as the former, email us at [{{ site.emails.info }}](http://{{ site.emails.info }})!

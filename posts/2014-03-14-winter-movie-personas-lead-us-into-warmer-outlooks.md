Our Spring Collection is here! Every other week we will be debuting a new inspiration from our collection. Our talented team focused on specific character styles in movies from this past Winter.

The first movie is _[The Wolf of Wall Street](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846) _starring [Leonardo DiCaprio](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138), who won 2 awards this past award season, and [Jonah Hill](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1706767), who was nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role by the [Academy Awards](http://oscar.go.com/).

The man who wears _The Wolf of Wall Street_ look is one who emits confidence. He knows what he wants and goes after it. He shows this not only in attitude but also in his wardrobe. The suits are clean and crisp while always looking to be fashion forward in details.

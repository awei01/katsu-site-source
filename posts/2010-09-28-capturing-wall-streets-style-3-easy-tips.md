The movie, _Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps_, just opened in the theater. How polished do the characters look in the movie! I know it's easy to fall into the business casual trap (Dockers and a button-down shirt). But, why not elevate your look for this fall with three easy tips? The looks are effortless...I promise.

It's all about the cut. Choose a slim silhouette that is tailored through the body.[![](http://www.gq.com/images/style/2010/03/shia-labeouf/shia-labeouf04.jpg)](http://www.gq.com/images/style/2010/03/shia-labeouf/shia-labeouf04.jpg)
3. Finally, complete your look with a vest. Jacket optional.

In a recent WSJ.com article, costume designer, Ellen Mirojnick mentioned that Shia LaBoeuf's character, Jake Moore, wears six custom suits (some featured above) - each worth about $6,500.

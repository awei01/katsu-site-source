![malebox_main_nov2015](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/malebox_main_nov2015.jpg) We're bringing back the holiday **Male Box**! The **Male Box** is a curated gift box, chock full of goodies for that special someone. The **Male Box** includes: two cuff links, two pocket squares and one pair of socks from our favorite men's socks purveyor, [A Man Among Socks](https://amanamongsocks.com/). We chose our favorite accessories and combined colors and patterns into stylish ensembles. Each piece can be worn on its own or with other items from The **Male Box**. It's a perfectly coordinated capsule that is great as a stocking stuffer or under the tree. All of these accessories together in one gift for $35.00 (including tax). Shipping is available for $3.00.  As an option, you can give your **Male Box** an extra boost by adding a physical gift card for a custom dress shirt or custom suit. Contact us at [info@9tailors.com](mailto:info@9tailors.com) or at 617.286.6135 for more information.

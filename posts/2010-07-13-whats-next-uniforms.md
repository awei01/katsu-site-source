The Sartorialist recently posted about this bartender in his uniform. It's true, very few companies really pay attention to their uniforms these days. As Scott from the Sartorialist states, "I would love to see a return of pride in wearing a uniform, not only from the people wearing the uniforms, but also from the companies providing the uniforms. " 

As you saw with our Liberty Hotel photo shoot, 9tailors does take pride in designing and fitting uniforms. We are looking to partner with more businesses like the Liberty Hotel and continue to grow our custom uniform line.

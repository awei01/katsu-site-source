Over the past 2 years, athletic wear has made its way outside the gym. You see people wearing sweatpants with blazers, sneakers with skirts, athletic jackets with dress pants, and so on. The beauty of this trend is that you can comfortably leave the house in your slightly too expensive sweats, and still look put together! That is, however, if you execute it stylishly. Here are a few tips and looks that can help get you on the right side of what can only be described as ‘athleisure’.  Below is an example of the less sporty side of atheisure. This is a great look to try if you’re not quite sure how to get away with wearing sweats in public yet. Try pairing cuffed pants with low top sneakers instead of dress shoes. Then throw on a comfy knit with a slick bomber jacket and add a textured coat on top for the ultimate layered look.

A blazer and sweatpants? Trust us, this is next level stuff. Be sure to opt for a patterned but neutral tee with this look, to give the blazer something to frame.  Another key point is to make sure your pants are somewhere between jeans and actual sweatpants. These are usually described as joggers. What separates them from something you would wear for a day on the couch, is the bunched up and slightly slimmer bottom half.

The dark grey sweater and pants are what pull it together. Monochrome and athletic wear usually pair very nicely. The accent in the shoes also gives this look a little boost.

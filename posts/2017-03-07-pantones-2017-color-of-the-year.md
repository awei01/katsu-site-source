It's time to say goodbye to the Pantone's 2016 colors Rose Quartz and Serenity and welcome their 2017 color of the year: **Greenery**.

Pantone writes:

> _"Greenery is a fresh and zesty yellow-green shade that evokes the first days of spring when nature's greens revive, restore and renew. Illustrative of flourishing foliage and the lushness of the great outdoors, the fortifying attributes of Greenery signals consumers to take a deep breath, oxygenate and reinvigorate__."_

While Rose Quartz and Serenity evoked a sense of mindfulness and relaxation Greenery symbolizes **new beginnings and energy**.

With St. Patrick's Day just a few weeks away now is a great time to be on the lookout for that pop of green to add to your existing wardrobe. Having a hard time finding that perfect shade of green? No worries! Since the weather will be heating up pretty soon we'd recommend staying away from forest green and going with a brighter springtime shade of green.

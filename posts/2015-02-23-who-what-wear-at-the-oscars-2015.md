Although it can be sometimes grueling to make it all the way through the Oscars, it can be worth it to see what everyone is wearing! Here are a few notables from last night.

First off, Neil Patrick Harris. With a million outfit changes (including a simple one down to his skivvies), his tuxedos were tailored to perfection.

A few gentlemen donned classy velvet tuxedo jackets, making for a stylish change without going too bold. Chris Pratt looking dapper in black velvet, Common in a midnight navy and NPH in a jewel-toned blue.

Speaking of bold, a little color (or a lot, Leto) never hurt anyone! We loved David Oyelowo's dark red ensemble, Eddie Redmayne's brighter navy tux and Jared Leto's pastel pop.

When it comes down to it, you can't go wrong with a classic tuxedo for a formal occasion. Chris Pine, Channing Tatum and Michael Keaton are just a few of those who did it right.

All in all, we were happy with the menswear outcome this year. A well-tailored tuxedo can make anyone look like a celebrity. Contact us at [{{ site.emails.info }}]({{ site.emails.info }}) for yours...because who knows when your next award show or Oscars after party might be?

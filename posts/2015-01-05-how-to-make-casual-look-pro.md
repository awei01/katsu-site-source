Whether your workplace is all about casual or more on the conservative side, it's good to know how to incorporate casual looks in a professional manner. Here are a few tips on how to upgrade your business casual look.

**TIP #1: Denim/Chambray** - Sneaking in a soft denim or chambray shirt under your suit will give you a stylish look, with a hint of casual.

**TIP #2: The Crewneck** - While it's normally a comfortable weekend item, a cozy crewneck sweater worn under a blazer is the perfect balance of business and casual. No one will even know you switched out the less-comfortable button down for what feels like pajamawear!

**TIP #3: Plaid** - Throw a nice plaid on under layers or even on it's own. It's a louder pattern than your standard blues and whites and changes up your formal wardrobe in a great way.

**TIP #4: Khakis** - Invest in a nice, crisp pair of khakis and pair them with the above-mentioned plaid shirt. Make sure they fit well and have a distinct crease, making them all the more dressed-up.

**TIP #5: Fit** \- The number one factor in making casual look pro is fit. You could come to work in a high-end suit, shirt and tie and still look like a guy who doesn't have it together if it doesn't fit. Oversized, baggy, hang-off-your-shoulder suits have never done anyone any good (check out our post on [shirt fit](http://2014/08/does-your-shirt-fit-you-correctly.html)). As long as you have nice, fitted clothing and know how to pair your items up, you can make almost anything look ready for the workplace. That's where 9tailors comes in.

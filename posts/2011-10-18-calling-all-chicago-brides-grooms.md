Our [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/) Wedding Style Consultants will be in Chicago the first week of November to meet with brides and grooms.

During your appointment, you'll meet one-on-one with a Wedding Style Consultant, who will provide advice on how to outfit the groom and his wedding party in our custom tuxedos, suits or dress shirts. The Style Consultant will answer all of your questions and navigate all the choices so that your groom will look his most dashing and stylish on the day of the wedding.

There is no obligation to purchase anything at the appointment. Appointments are always free of charge.

9tailors [wedding parties](http://9tailors.com/catalogs/weddings) of 3 or more will receive a 15% discount towards their custom outfits.

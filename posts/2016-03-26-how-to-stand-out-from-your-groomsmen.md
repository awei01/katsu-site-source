Sure, all eyes will be on your significant other, but you deserve to be the center of attention as well. We know distinguishing yourself from the masses can be a bit daunting. If you are not sure how to make yourself stand out from your posse, that's where we come in. We have four no-fail ways that you can use to differentiate yourself from your wedding party and guests. The more formal the dress code the less variation you will have. Hosting a black tie affair? It is safe to say everyone will probably be in a black tuxedo. If your dress code is not as strict you'll definitely be able to enjoy yourself when it comes to your attire.

#### **Option #1: A Three Piece Suit**

Want to be a bit more formal than your groomsmen? A 3-piece suit is the way to go. You'll wear the full suit for the ceremony. After your first dance you can ditch your suit jacket and still have on a full ensemble. Since most of your guest will likely be wearing a 2-piece suit having the vest will help differentiate you from everyone else. That way you won't get lost in the crowd on your big day.

#### **Option #2: Wear a Lighter or Darker Shade**

Another alternative is to wear a lighter or darker shade than your groomsmen. Keep in mind that darker colors are more formal. If you and your wife to be are hosting a more formal affair you have the option to wear a charcoal grey and your groomsmen can wear a medium grey. This can work with any color. Thinking you want to wear a more modern royal blue? Put your groomsmen in a classic navy suit. This will also be a great investment piece for your groomsmen. Everyone needs a navy suit!

#### **Option #3: Wear a Different Color**

Can't decide which color to choose for the big day? Why not choose two! If your wedding is more formal you can wear a blue tuxedo and your groomsmen can wear black. This is a great option for those of you who want a more modern take on the classic tuxedo. If you think the blue tuxedo may be a bit more trendy than you would like opt for a blue tux jacket and black pants. This will help tone down the bright blue of your jacket.

\*9tailors Tip: If you think you want to wear black pants and your jacket has blue satin we suggest going without the tuxedo stripe down the side of your pants. This will help create a more streamlined look.

Another great option is navy and grey. These two colors look great together. Keep your ties and pocket squares in the same color family so that there aren't too many colors in the mix. Try a lighter tie and pocket square, as seen below, to add a bit of contrast to your navy suit.

#### **Option #4: The Tie vs. The Bow Tie**

This option is a more subtle approach. This works great for those of you with a stricter dress code. Want to take it a step further? Like the gentlemen pictured below, you can wear a different color from your groomsmen and a bow tie. We suggest wearing the same color tie. If you would like to wear more than one color keeping the ties in the same color family works best.

**Steal This Style: Simon Baker**

Australian-born actor Simon Baker is the man of the hour with his simple, classic style both on and off the small screen. Most known for his role as Patrick Jane on the hits series The Mentalist, Simon has also appeared on People’s 100 Most Beautiful People in both 2002 and 2009. His ability to pair more formal design elements with casual day wear makes him a style icon rivaling that of a young [Sean Connery](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rf5KTPVqRYM/TZ5L4GZX2gI/AAAAAAAABMw/aSHkKn7gq60/s1600/sean-connery-james-bond.jpg&imgrefurl=http://warlockshomebrew.blogspot.com/2011/04/poll-whos-your-bond-james-bond.html&usg=__QMJ7jN). Looking for a more formal look minus the bowtie? Try a monochromatic suit and dress shirt with a pop of color, preferably in a [silk pocket square](http://www.brooksbrothers.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=1&Section_Id=553&Product_Id=886651&Parent_Id=228&sort_by=&sectioncolor=&sectionsize=#null). ![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GIfvekKZryw/TefNLB0j6WI/AAAAAAAAA7M/GN_WlW0kW0A/s320/09f51861ad0262e3bc4b697dcaf2483ad.jpg)       A Summer’s day must: classic gray vest. Match your vest to your trousers or go for a subtle contrasting pattern like a pinstripe or windowpane check. ![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oi8eJxj2AXE/TefN3Uzo91I/AAAAAAAAA7k/-1mYHpNiDPc/s320/simon-baker-and-robin-tunney-3.jpg)

Add a twist to your 9tailors dress shirt! Opt for a more formal French fly front placket and add a pocket to keep the look on the casual side. A charcoal gray is a perfect segue from casual Friday to after work drinks.

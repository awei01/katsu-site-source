Last week was an exciting week for 9tailors! We participated in our first ever fashion show. The fashion show was hosted by Harvard Business School's Retail & Apparel and Social Enterprise Clubs. It was a mix of up-and-coming designers, like [Lily and Migs](http://www.lilyandmigs.com/Lily_%26_Migs_Clothing), and more established brands.

Best of all? All proceeds from the evening went to [Conservation International](http://www.conservation.org/Pages/default.aspx), a non-profit organization on a mission to protecting the environment.

Photos below were taken by the very talented, Bill Downey.

Beat the Belly Bulge

I don't know one woman who has not worn a pair of [Spanx](http://www.spanx.com/home/index.jsp) ("SFM") or has not heard of them. Shapewear for women is a multi-billion dollar business....who wants insightly bulges? Not I. To many, Spanx and the founder, [Sara Blakely](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/219367), are a godsend because Spanx smooths and separates. But, Spanx for men? When I asked my husband if he wanted to wear SFM, he responded saying, "Why would I want to wear them?"
Well, here are a few compelling reason:
If you have a mostly desk job, work a ton of hours, just don't want to eat right, or don't have time commit to [P90X](http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/p90x.do?code=SEMB_GOOGLE_P90X&extcmp=e79dc8a93ec8447a&ef_id=nPtM4KKrAgAAK7M:20110323121109:s), [Spanx for Men](http://www.spanx.com/category/index.jsp?categoryId=3955558&clickid=topnav_men_txt) is for you.

What we like about SFM...

	***It really does slim.** It eliminates man boobs, narrows the waist, and reduces unsightly button pulling (don't be like [this guy](http://www.fashioncentral.pk/images/health-sports/fat_belly_t.jpg)). It's been tested by real people...Read the review on the SFM from connoisseur of under garments, [The Undershirt Guy](http://www.undershirtguy.com/undershirt-review-spanx-for-men-cotton-compression-undershirt/).
	***It looks just like an undershirt.** This is important as you don't want your undershirt to confused with a man girdle.
	***It feels amazing!** Without a doubt, Sara Blakely has developed a high quality product. Her women's version does the job, yet are very comfortable to wear. The undershirts are made in Egyptian Cotton for maximum softness and breath-ability. It also has Spandex/Elastene to hold everything in place without making you look like an over-stuffed sausage.
	***We** **like the style options.** It comes in round and v-neck (we like the v-neck option). It also comes in white, black and heather gray too. For men looking for a sleeveless option, Spanx has got you covered.
	***And...it comes with [matching boxers](http://www.spanx.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4410078&cp=4017325.4427303&parentPage=family)!** The boxers have an innovative 3D pouch allowing for proper air circulation. The fabric reduces irritation as well. Lastly, there is a comfortable compression around the legs (again, no sausage legs here) for a contoured look.

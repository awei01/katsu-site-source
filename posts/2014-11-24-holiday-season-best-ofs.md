While it may seem like summer was just a week ago, the holidays are upon us! Here are a few tips for holiday attire that you can feel comfortable and look good in.

**Fair isle - **You can never go wrong with a fair isle print. Wear just a sweater, throw a cardigan over a button-down or layer it up under a blazer.

 **Stay warm!** - It's important to keep the extremities warm, especially when a polar vortex could swing your way any time (apparently)!

**Plaid** - Plaid is a great way to sneak in festive color without looking ridiculous. Great for layering and awesome with jeans, khakis and slacks, plaid is the perfect go-to.

**Drinks!** - Don't forget to stay warm with some holiday drinks. Spiked eggnog and hard cider are classic, or skip the booze with the perfect cup of cocoa.

**Avoid** - horrendous Christmas sweaters. Unless you're going to a party specifically designed to make fun of them, go ahead and don something else.

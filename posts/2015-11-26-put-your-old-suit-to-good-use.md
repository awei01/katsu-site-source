We are proud to announce we are holding another clothing drive this holiday season.

This year we have partnered with Boston Adult and Teen Challenge, a residential program for those struggling with addiction and other life-controlling issues. After providing vital resources for these individuals, t**he staff helps students develop resumes, practice interviewing and prepare for further education or the workforce.** Most of the students do not have professional clothing or the resources to buy it. That's where 9tailors comes in.

Last year, 9tailors clients donated over $15,000 worth of suits, shirts, and outerwear. With these contributions, BATC students had clothing for job interviews and work.

We also love that the clothing drive will help reduce some landfill and clothing waste as millions of tons of clothing and textiles are unnecessarily discarded each year. Your gently-worn suit will get another chance at life.

Bring us your new or gently-worn suits and work attire and receive 15% off on full-price 9tailors purchases over $150.00. Clothing drive lasts until December 24th, 2015.

[Taylor Twellman](http://www.twellmansoccerne.com/), star soccer player for the [New England Revolution](http://www.revolutionsoccer.net/), and now sports analyst for [ESPN](http://espn.com/) and [Comcast SportsNet](http://www.csnne.com/), stopped by our studio last week to pick up his suit pants. We couldn't help but notice how dapper Taylor looked in his ensemble and snapped a picture or two. Taylor is a master of mixing patterns. He's been in the 9tailors studio a few times mixing shirting fabrics together. His favorite technique? Choose one color that he wants to match and find a pattern, such as checks and windowpanes (his favorite), with that color in it. He does this as easily as he handles a soccer ball down the field.

Check out his collar! Taylor chose a textured blue to match his checked shirt

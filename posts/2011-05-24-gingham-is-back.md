Our beloved summer fabric is back in the studio! And, we just can't get enough. Our lightweight gingham is available in royal blue, navy, black, red, green, purple and pink. Our gingham is regularly priced at $150.00. **However, through June 30, our gingham fabrics will be reduced to $135.00.** Want to avoid the picnic table look? No problem! Use gingham sparingly as an accent fabric under your collar or inside your cuff for an additional $20.00. Better yet...make a gingham pocket square for $30.00. Want to purchase your gingham today?

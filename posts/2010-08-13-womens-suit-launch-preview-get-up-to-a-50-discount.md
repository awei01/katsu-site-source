Here is a little sneak peek of our fall 2010 women's suit collection for our blog readers! We are using these three items- the 2 skirts on the ends and the middle jacket- in our fall 2010 suit photo shoot. After the photo shoot, I will post the photos of the real suits so you can compare them to the line drawings you see here. They should be up in a few weeks. Get excited! They're going to be absolutely fabulous.

What do you think of these designs? Is there anything in particular you're dying to see?

Keep in mind that these are only a few designs from our complete collection. We have 4 pant styles, 5 jacket styles, and 5 skirt styles available. Pricing:

**Jacket: $295 (beta price $160)** **Trouser: $195 (beta price $125)** **Skirt: $180 (beta price $110)**

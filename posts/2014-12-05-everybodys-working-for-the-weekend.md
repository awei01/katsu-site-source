While all you may want to be in is sweats after a long week, it isn't always the most flattering of choices. Here are a few different casual looks that you can wear on the weekend so you can feel comfy _and _look good. **The semi-put-together** - Throw a sweater over a button down, pair it with some jeans and some casual shoes or boots.

And the best part? No need to match the various shades - it'll look effortless and put together at the same time.

Throw a t-shirt, button down or crew neck on under a blazer or pea coat, pair with jeans and you're good to go. ![Blazer Outerwear Casz](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Blazer-Outerwear-Casz-1024x446.jpg)   ****DETAILS**** **Pants** - While jeans are the easiest, they aren't your only casual option. Try putting some colored chinos or khakis in rotation as well as your favorite pair of jeans. [![Colored Pantz](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Colored-Pantz1-1024x558.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Colored-Pantz1.jpg) **Shoes** - There are really no limits on weekend footwear, as long as you're not wearing your shiny black dress shoes with jeans (BIG no-no). Try some slip-on or lace up boots, classic white sneakers or some fun running sneakers. All of these paired with jeans, khakis or whatever you choose will look good.

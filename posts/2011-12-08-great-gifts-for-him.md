I always have trouble buying gifts for the guys in my life, from brothers to fathers to really, good guy friends. It can be very daunting! So, we've created a [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/) gift giving guide.

**Want a gift for under $100?** 

This is great for your brother, who's a college senior and needs a better fitting shirt for job interviews and recruiting events. It's time to steer him away from "vintage" [graphic tees](http://www.buyabercrombiefitch.org/bmz_cache/7/2011-new-abercrombie-and-fitch-men-graphic-tees-595.image.130x130.jpg) and help him get one step closer to landing that first job. Not only that, many of our fabrics under $100 are wrinkle resistant. Just another fantastic reason, this shirt would be perfect for your easy-going, younger brother.

One of our favorites. Seafoam green herringbone with his initials for $89.00.

Seafoam not your favorite? Try a red striped shirt with a special button, also $89.00.

Want a great gift for under $175?

For your dad or special someone, you might consider a gift that is under $175.00. For the fellow with discerning taste, drape him soft, luxury cottons many in [Egyptian](http://www.ehow.com/facts_5760791_definition-egyptian-cotton.html) or Italian blends. For the creative guy, allow him to personalize it with contrast fabrics, special buttons. Either way, he'll stand out in a good way.

Winter white. White piqued fabric with a rounded, [spread collar](http://knol.google.com/k/wearing-a-spread-collar#) for $135.00

Now that the cold weather is rapidly approaching, it’s time to make some changes to the way you accessorize. Summer is a time for simplicity, so you’ve most likely been accustomed to a daily uniform of sunglasses and shorts, but colder weather calls for more than just that! Take a closer look into these 5 must have accessories for men, and how you can pull them off. 

#### **A Timeless Timepiece**

 Watches have always been a staple in a gentleman’s wardrobe. Keep this manly tradition going by investing in one really good watch. It’s better to have one or two high quality watches, than several grungy or faulty ones. Of course you could just use your cellphone, but a watch is more discreet, and a hundred times more manly. **If you want to mix it up and add a little color in your life, you can always buy a watch with interchangeable wristbands. They’re easy to find, and save you the trouble of getting more than one!** ![CH3000SET_main](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/CH3000SET_main.jpg)

#### **Ties**

 Most men wouldn’t consider a tie an accessory. Many see it as an essential part of any professional man’s wardrobe. Although that is true, a tie can also function as an accessory that pulls your whole outfit together. Of course you have all the essentials: black, grey, navy, and a few patterned ties in the mix. Never underestimate the power of a good textured tie. A simple textured tie can easily make you look more put together and fashion forward.  These ties from The Tie Bar are a great example.

Thick lapel, thick tie. 

#### **Scarves**

 Styling the ultimate fall accessory might seem unnecessary, but how you wear it is what makes it an accessory! Otherwise, it’s just another layer. Of course when looking for a scarf, warmth is key, but it wouldn’t hurt to use it to add a little flare to your outfit. Opt for cashmere, warm browns, and maybe a checkered pattern if you’re drawn to simpler styles. When looking for scarves, it’s important to keep in mind that you want it to look good with your work attire, and your leather jacket (if you don’t have one, get one). Check out this perfect zara scarf below. [![pasted image 0 (3)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/pasted-image-0-3-258x300.png)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/pasted-image-0-3.png)    

#### **Sunglasses**

 This year round essential is just that. Essential.  The key to getting that cool mysterious look is getting frames that fit your face shape. Most face shapes, however, can get away with a classic aviator.  Also, again, it’s better to invest in one or two classic styles (and take care of them) than to have a lot of trendy ones that might only last a month. **** [![aviators](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/aviators.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/aviators.jpg)****  

#### **A Handy Handkerchief**

 Without a handkerchief you might find yourself with an ugly stain on your shirt, a runny nose, or even a child crying with nothing to wipe their tears away. A handkerchief can be used for so many things, including a great accessory. It’s the perfect gentleman’s secret weapon. This stylish and timeless piece is definitely a must have for any man, and needless to say, pretty handy.  There are also many ways to carry around a handkerchief. For example you could fold it and have it hanging out of your back pocket slightly, or just keep it hidden in your jacket. Either way, you’ll be glad you have it with you.  This patchwork silk hanky from H&M could do the trick.

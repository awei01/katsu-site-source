With Thanksgiving coming up just around the corner we all begin thinking about the holidays. For many, holidays mean Christmas parties, charity galas, and New Year's extravaganzas. We don't know about you but here at 9tailors we believe that one should celebrate in style and what can be more stylish than a spiffy new tuxedo?

If you haven't purchased a tuxedo in a while or if you don't own one yet, now is the PERFECT time. Beginning this Monday, November 20th we are offering **10% off your tuxedo order**. Call us at 617-286-6135 or email {{ site.emails.info }} to set up an appointment with one of our fabulous style consultants.

There are just a few rules and regulations:

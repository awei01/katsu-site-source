Valentine's Day is on a Saturday this year, so you have a ton of choices as to the day's activities. Here are a few ideas we love:

Wake up early and surprise your loved one with breakfast in bed. Not the best cook? Lucky for you, Foodler exists and [The Paramount](http://www.foodler.com/the-paramount/menu/14606/bb) is on it. Amazing breakfast, at your delivery fingertips.

After either a lazy morning in (or maybe a nice walk if you want to venture into the cold...) try a couples spa date at [Bella Sante](http://bellasante.com/valentines-gift-cards/). Planning to skip the craziness of Valentine's night out on the town and cook at home? Stop by the new Whole Foods at Ink Block and drop your lady off at [Milk + Honey Spa](http://milkandhoneyspa.com/valentines-day-specials-boston/#specials) while you pick up ingredients for your Michelin star-worthy creation.

Need ideas for dinner out? Head over to [Craigie on Main](http://www.craigieonmain.com/) for a fantastic Valentine's meal. If you wait too long and can't get a reservation, make one for Sunday night! They're making Valentine's a weekend affair.

Another option is to whisk your loved one away to a faux Paris at [Petit Robert](http://petitrobertbistro.com/happy-new-year-2015/). They are offering a lovely prix fixe three course meal menu for $65.

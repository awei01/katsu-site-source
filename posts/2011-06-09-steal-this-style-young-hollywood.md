Know for its wild antics and fun vibe the MTV Movie awards was full of fashion malfunctions as well as relaxed ensembles that bode well for the summer heat. Below are some men that did their job well. Dark colors were the order of the day with many of the attendees cloaked in navy. They give off a relaxed vibe without looking sloppy and have thrown in some unique accessories to make the look their own.

Also working with navy he has paired it with a pair of neural colored bucks that anchor the look nicely.

His styling keeps the look from looking too formal in such a casual setting. The loose tie brings the formality down a notch and the chain across the front of the vest brings in a playful component.

This is a pretty casual look that he made slightly more formal by choosing nicely tailors pieces. Want to replicate the looks above?

With [pocket squares](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief) becoming more and more common we are in turn addressing more and more questions concerning the proper way to utilize the accessory.  How exactly do you craft that little square in your pocket to showcase your style?  Are you artfully disheveled?  Exacting and angular? Or, simply confused?

Lets break it down.  While some [dandies](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dandy) have specific requirements on how a pocket square should be folded, we are proponents of doing it your way- hence the DIY (design it yourself) approach.

The Triangle- some men like the angular look and fold their pocket squares into triangles and have the points poke out at various angles.  This is a very sharp look.  Sharp in the sense it looks clean and exacting. Generally this would work out well for people who prefer razor sharp lines and no fuss.

The Square- oft referred to as a classic, this has somewhat fallen out of favor.  While it also has a sharp look like the triangle, this is easier to manipulate in order to only show the slightest sliver of silk. The square could be considered the beginners pocket square.

The Pouf- granted this is simply how I have labeled it, but the look, in reflection of the name, is playful.  This is great for patterned pocket squares so you get more exposure, as well as a more casual look in a friendly environment. It is pictured below as part of a more casual suit-with-no-tie combo.

Many exciting things have happened since I last posted an entry.

	*I rang in the new year with champagne... and more champagne.
	*9tailors celebrated 3 birthdays in the month of December (Kate, Justin, and myself).
	*My brother and his girlfriend got engaged!
	*And, we delivered our first order to our client.

Here is what our first client had to say (for real...she really did say all of this):"An absolutely beautiful, light, lime green dress for my younger cousin! She looks stunning in it! The process was very personalized and efficient: 9tailors answered my questions and provided helpful advice in a friendly, professional manner. I will definitely refer my family and friends to 9tailors!" 
Even though my head is a little fuzzy from the holiday, I must toast our success with another glass bubbly.

So, if you are attending a million weddings this upcoming wedding season and you simply can't find anything to wear, why not create a one-of-a-kind dress from 9tailors? E-mail us at {{ site.emails.info }}.

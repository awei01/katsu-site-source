Yesterday we spent the day working with the wonderful photographers of [Avanti Studios](http://www.avantistudios.com/Artist.asp?ArtistID=15488&Akey=VWLPV2G6) based out of the [South End](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_End,_Boston) in Boston. They were so fantastic to work with and we also love their photos. This spring we focused on refining our suit collection by adding some elegant and sophisticated details to our suits. Here's a sneak peak. Let us know what you think!

What to buy for the man who has it all? Let's face it, patriarchs are hard to shop for, especially when they are refined, particular sticklers for what they like. Esquire has given some [helpful hints](lhttp://www.esquire.com/the-side/style-guides/stylish-fathers-day-gifts-2012#slide-1) to what may make the most stylish fathers swoon. Still stumped looking for items to get Dad for Father's Day? Enter 9tailors. Think custom. If you didn't know about our [Buy 3, Get 1 Free](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2012/05/its-back-for-june-buy-3-get-1-free.html) promotion this month, it's still going on through the end of June! You're giving Dad the freedom to design his own shirts and choose his own fabrics.  Spare yourself the frantic guesswork of choosing something you "think" he'll like. Rather than eyeing which off-the-rack shirt _could_ fit him, you're purchasing a shirt that _will_ fit him...very well, indeed. Personalized gifts make that much more of an impact anyway.  Thoughtfulness is the best present someone can receive! Not to mention, once we have the measurements of the father(s) in your life, he'll finally own a shirt that fits his proportions.

And don't forget about the other items we offer here in the [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) studio. [Sterling Kane](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/search?q=sterling+kane) leather goods, made-to-order! Premium leather in exquisite quality at affordable prices. Or if you're buying the customary Father's Day tie, why not throw in a [tie thing](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2012/02/thing-tie-thing.html) for good measure? It's a nifty little accessory that keeps ties in their proper place as well as a handy contraption for guys on the go. [OooTie](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2012/04/oootie-bow-tie-all-right-all-right-all.html) Bow ties and [Dressed By CC](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2012/05/meet-christopher-pocket-squares-simple.html) pocket squares also available for purchase!

Still can't decide what to get? Perhaps a suit or suit separate with a meaningful monogram embroidered inside? [Gift certificates](http://9tailors.com/gifts) are also available.

Emmi Sorokin is a nationally-renowned men's fashion stylist and author of [_The Business Casual Survival Guide: 30 Looks for Men_](http://www.amazon.com/The-Business-Casual-Survival-Guide/dp/0615925138/). Emmi's clients double their income, get out of the friend zone and win Supreme Court cases.

Emmi has been featured on NPR, as well as in publications such as Men's Health, Details, and Bloomberg News.

We recently had the chance to chat with Emmi about how she got started in the business, her favorite seasonal trends and how men can transition their wardrobe when they are new in town.

**_9tailors:_** What sparked your interest in becoming a men's stylist?

**_Emmi Sorokin:_** The spark came early, though I honed in on men's style later in life. I've been styling people since the tender age of six. As a child we were immigrants to this country and moved around a lot, and I became painfully aware that the biggest influencing factor for how people treat you right off the bat (or boat in that case) is how you're dressed. Being teased mercilessly as a child, watching my sister get bullied, and seeing my parents disrespected repeatedly sparked an obsession with clothing and style as a tool for social survival.

**_9T:_** How was It's A Man's World born?

**_EM:_ **Years later, while I running a tech start up, I saw that those laws of social nature were still in play. I witnessed countless talented guys miss out professionally and socially because they had a blind spot to their style. One day the call just became too strong; I sold my tech startup and started styling "professionally". The power of wearing the right clothes is that it brings out your best self, and it's the most satisfying feeling in the world to put those missing pieces into place for someone.

**_9T:_** What are some fashion tips you can give to men who have never been styled before?

_**EM:**  _When working with a stylist for the first time and trying on new clothes, trust your gut about whether or not you'll wear something, but don't be certain in advance of what you do and don't like. Going in trusting your own instinct, while still keeping an open mind, is the secret sauce for getting an ideal wardrobe.

_**9T:** _When styling clients, how do you help them find a balance between staying true to their personal style, and a more trendy look?

_**EM:** _Most men would prefer to invest in modern yet not overly styled core pieces, and then when appropriate mix in trendier accessories. There are exceptions of course, especially if someone has a very developed style already or if they're dressing for a performance. 

**9T:**  What are your top three favorite trends in menswear right now?

_**EM:** _My three favorite trends in menswear right now are:

1\. That now anything goes as long as it's worn with confidence and fitting perfectly.

2\. The continued casualification of suiting.

**3\. The seed stages of menswear and technology merging.**

**_9T:_** What are some timeless essentials for the cold weather than men can stock up on now?

_**EM:** _A casual winter jacket. A lot of men still only have a wool coat for business and a ski jacket, but nothing in between for social outings.

_**9T:** _What style advice would you give to someone new to Boston, looking to dress to impress?

****_EM:_ **Looking good in Boston (or any city) involves being dressed for your zip code, activity, audience, and personal confidence level. It's a lot of moving parts but when you nail it it's like an all-access pass to anything you want in life.**

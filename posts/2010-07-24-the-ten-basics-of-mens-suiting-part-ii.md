Want to become a suiting pro? We previously posted 5 tips on men's suiting, and today we will complete the series with 5 more must-know basics.

(If you missed the first five tips, click [here](http://2010/07/10-basics-of-mens-suiting-part-i.html)!)

1\. **Shirt and suit combinations**: When matching up a shirt with your suit, make sure at least one part is more simple than the other. For example, if you have a gray suit, it is okay to wear a patterned shirt. While wearing a patterned suit (ie. bold pinstripes or herringbone) it is best to go with a solid-color shirt.

2\. **Tie and shirt combinations**: Along with matching your suit and shirt, your tie must also coordinate. If the shirt is bold, make sure to go with a tie that is more subtle. Similarly, if the shirt is plain (ie. white or blue) you can choose a tie that is more bold in pattern or color.

For a more trendy look, try mixing patterns! But, make sure that the scope and size of the pattern varies; for example, try a small check shirt with a wider print tie-the shirt and tie do not have to be the same pattern!

3\. **Suiting Fabrics**: Suits are most often made of wool, which is sometimes blended with cashmere. More casual summer suits can be made out of cotton and sometimes linen. 

4\. **Fabric Patterns**: While many suits are traditionally solid fabrics, pinstripes are a good option to brighten up your suit wardrobe. Stripes may be thin or thick, alternating colors such as gray and blue, or shades of grays and blacks. 

5\. **Fit**: To complete a perfect suit, it is important for your suit to fit properly! Suits can range from skinny fit to a more comfortable, American-style fit. A well-fitting suit will be fitted in the shoulders and waist. The jacket sleeve length should be slightly shorter than the shirt sleeve length, so that about a half inch of the shirt shows.

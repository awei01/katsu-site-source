Many of you might be asking yourselves, what makes a 9tailors suit a 9tailors suit? Here are some things to consider.

From American (boxy) to Skinny (very slim), we allow our clients to determine the fit of their suit. For the most part, our jackets are tailored through the shoulders and torso. Our pants are slim through the hip, thigh and pant opening. That's right. No saggy butt or pork chop leg for you.

**Fabric:** Choose from one of our 700 suiting fabrics (super 120s to 180s wool). **Lapel**: We currently offer 4 lapel styles from men, including the Nehru. If you would prefer a slim lapel, we also offer that option as well. **Vents**: None, single and double. Isn't it nice to have options?

Customize your lining by choosing from our pink, purple, yellow and blue options. **Armhole guard**: Yes. We reinforce this area to prolong the life of your armhole. **Welted Edge**: All the edges are welted in your jacket. That gives the inside lining a very clean look. **Pants**: Slip Guard for your dress shirts shirts. It's important to us that your shirt stays tucked in.

Others not. **Sleeve Buttons**: Choose from our 3, 4, or 5 button options.

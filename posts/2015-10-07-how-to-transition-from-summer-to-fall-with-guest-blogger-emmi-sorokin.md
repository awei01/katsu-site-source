Last week we introduced you to men's stylist Emmi Sorokin as our guest blogger. In case you missed it, we've got you covered. [Check it out here!](http://blog.9tailors.com/2015/10/meet-mens-fashion-stylist-guest-blogger-emmi-sorokin/) This week she is bringing you the key pieces you'll need as you transition from the summer to fall. Breaking out the fall wardrobe can feel like the final nail in summer’s coffin. Rather than making one big drastic whole-afternoon-sucking wardrobe turnover while it’s still nice to be outside, you can hang on to the warm weather vibes and enjoy an easy gradual shift. To do this all you need are a couple of blazers, a sweater, and a few choice accessories. Here are 6 ideas for an easy summer to fall wardrobe transition.

#### **Tip #1:**

Think textures. Summer linens pair handsomely with fall tweeds. Wear a tweed or rich camel color blazer over a bright button-down, or over a summer sweater.

#### **Tip #2:**

Keep your jewel-toned chinos rolling through the entire year and change up the shoes; add a rugged boot or suede slip-on for a more autumnal flavor.

#### **Tip #3:**

You can extend the life of any summer look by adding a grey cardigan as a lightweight jacket, and extend it further still with the right hat.

#### **Tip #4:**

A lightweight scarf with an open weave or graphic print can provide a bit of warmth while adding distinction to your whole look. [![redskull-scarf](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/redskull-scarf-1024x778.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/redskull-scarf.jpg)

#### **Tip #5:**

Add a suede belt and olive sunglasses for instant fall style. [![burgundy suede belt(2)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/burgundy-suede-belt2-1024x629.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/burgundy-suede-belt2.jpg)

#### **Tip #6:**

Toss a cashmere sport coat over your favorite summer chambray shirt and denim. Complete the look with burgundy shoes and a burnt orange cotton pocket square in your sport coat.

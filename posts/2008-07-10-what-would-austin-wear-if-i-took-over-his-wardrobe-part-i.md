Austin loves his New Balance sneakers. While there is nothing particularly wrong with them (they are very practical for vigorous outdoor activity), the shoes don't really say, "I'm a gentleman." So, what would Austin wear if I took over his wardrobe? I would want to buy a pair that is comfortable, modern and sharp. And, I would definitely choose a pair that doesn't make him look like a frat boy.

Below are some sporty, classy and grown-up options for him.

If I had a million dollars this is what I would choose:

Since I don't...these will do:

But he won't let me take over his wardrobe, so I have to live with these:

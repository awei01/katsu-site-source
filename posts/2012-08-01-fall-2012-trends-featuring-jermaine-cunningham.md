Just look at the dapper [Mr. Cunningham](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1278464-new-england-patriots-training-camp-jermaine-cunningham-is-turning-heads-early)... yes sir.

## FALL 2012 TRENDS

### Double-breasted Suits.

[Milan's runways](http://www.focusonstyle.com/fashion-shows/top-trends-from-milan-fallwinter-2012-menswear/) lent themselves to slim double-breasted suits and animal-print sweaters. Yes, gentlemen, double-breasted is making a major comeback. Single-breasted remains a stiff contender, however.

### The Three-Piece Suit.

If you haven't visited  [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) before, you know not of our love for the three-piece. [GQ](http://www.gq.com/style/wear-it-now/201208/joseph-gordon-levitt-suits-gq-august-2012#slide=5) calls this out as the Fall must-have. And why not? It looks great with all three pieces showing and when you take your jacket off to showcase that sharp vest. And to reiterate, gray is the best versatile color out there. Seen below on Jermaine—wicked shahhhhp.

If you already have enough suits in your closet but need that vest for a finishing touch, you can always opt to get one in a complementary color. Gray suit? Go for a navy vest. Brown suit? Try a tan vest. Or if you're feeling frisky, try a checked or pin-stripe pattern to give some oomph to your ensemble. 

### Conversation-Starting Shoes

Shoes that make a statement, according to [NYMag](http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2012/01/fall-2012-menswear-trend-statement-shoes.html), are in this Fall. Check the foot-candy on Jermaine!
Now, this is a touchy subject, some of the shoes on the runways are obviously not conservative enough for business meetings and the like, but you can dress up your feet with a bit of pizazz just in detail or texture, rather than going all out on funky designs and colors that scream.

### Shearling Coats

Did you see _The Dark Knight Rises_? Did you notice how dope Bane's jacket was? We'll be seeing lots of faux-fur lined jackets and shearling coats this fall. Think grungy, lumberjack, living-in-the-woods-and-being-a-man's-man. Not to mention, a coat like this looks badass paired with a suit or jeans.

### Patterns! Knit ties! 

Autumn is the best time of year to play with textures and patterns. Remember our post on [knit ties](http://2012/03/try-this-accessory-knit-ties.html) a few months back? You'll be seeing more of these around as well.

 **What are your names?**
Bride: Genoa Polumbo
Groom: Greg Polumbo
 **Where and when was the big day?** 
7/7/12, San Diego, CA
 **How was the weather? Was your wedding indoors/outdoors?**
Sunny and perfect, outdoors, 5pm
 **Why did you decide to go with** [**9tailors**](http://www.9tailors.com/) **on your own custom design?**
Greg has longer-than-normal arms, and he's tall but not wide, so he has a hard time finding clothes that fit well. A friend had his wedding suit made with 9tailors, so we decided to do it, too!

 **What was the best part of your wedding day?**
All of it! Our officiant was awesome, the weather was beautiful. We had friends and family come from near and far, it was fun and colorful, and everything went off perfectly.

**Describe your 9tailors experience and items.**
Alex helped us through all of the decisions and it was really easy and fun. Making each decision separately (eg cuff buttons) helped a lot. We made a beautiful suit for Greg for our wedding.
 **What is your advice to other wedding couples thinking about designing custom suits or shirts?**
Go to 9tailors!

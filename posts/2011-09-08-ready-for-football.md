[Sergio Brown](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sergio-Brown/143140449079730), #31 on the [Patriots](http://patriots.com/), stopped by our studio last night for his first suit and shirt fitting. His suit arrived just in time for the Patriot's first game of the season. Here's how everything turned out:

Sergio chose a three-piece gray suit with lavender pinstripes. He's also wearing a lavender/pink shirt with a wide spread collar. With a nice pocket square and tie, it should complete the look!

Don't forget to tune in on Monday night to watch Sergio and Patriots play Miami!

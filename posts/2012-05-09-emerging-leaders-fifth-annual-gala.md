"A blast from the past that benefits everyone's future." The United Way's Emerging Leaders will be hosting a _Mad Men_\-themed gala, "Mad About Living United," this Saturday, May 12, from 7-11pm. Put on your best Don Draper or Joan Harris outfit and casually sip cocktails among 400+ of Boston's young professionals and philanthropists!

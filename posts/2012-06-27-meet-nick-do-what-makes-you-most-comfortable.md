Meet Nick Tafari, a sweet, laid-back, young gentleman with an individual style all his own. Seen here in a light gray wool-cashmere blend suit in a European cut, a color like this is perfect for daytime summer weddings! Read on to learn more about Nick and how he puts himself together. **Name:** Nick Tafari **Age:** 20 **Hometown:** Watch Hill, RI **Current Residence:** Boston, MA **Occupation:** Student

**How long have you been a 9tailors client?**

Since October 2011.

**Why choose custom?**

Buying a suit in Boston can be a pain, because a lot of places will try and put me in a boxy suit, in which I'd look terrible. I buy custom-made so that I can get a suit that forms well to my body, a suit that fits me just how I want it to fit. As a side note I hate how the bulky, formless fit of suits and tailored clothing is called "American". That always bothers me a little bit, because there are plenty of Americans who steer away from this look. I feel like "American fit" tells us that Americans are supposed to disappear underneath the tent put over their shoulders. I think American designers and clothing stores are definitely showing us that you don't need to go to Europe or pretend to be European to wear fitted clothing. I really love the easygoing, comfortable, judgment-free aspect that American style seems to stand for.

**What/who inspires your style? Why?** I just like simple, clean, clothes. I read _GQ_ and scroll through some photography blogs to see what people have put together themselves. I am a Rhode Island surfer and for years I really dressed like it. Recently, I have been mixing the surfer aspect with what I enjoy wearing now and I think its a cool vibe.  

**What is your favorite piece from 9tailors?** I'd say my favorite piece is my brown windowpane suit. It has an old school, vintage look but fits me perfectly so it looks brand new. I don't have many chances to whip it out, but when I do I feel like a boss.

**What would be your style advice to other men in your professional field?**

I am not really the type to give others advice about style, I guess I just say, "do what makes you most comfortable." I feel confident when I am wearing clothes that fit me well and express my personality. I wear some nautical jewelry because I love to remind myself of the ocean. It's really about myself and what makes me happiest, a little selfish I guess, but I might even go so far as to say, "don't listen to anyone that tells you how to dress." Every person is different and should be able to style themselves.

_Well said, sir._ Take a peak at some other shots of Nick's photo shoot, courtesy of our wonderful photographer, [Channing Johnson](http://www.channingjohnson.com/). Or, you can view more photos of Nick's shoot on our Facebook page [here](https://www.facebook.com/pages/9tailors/49696314250).

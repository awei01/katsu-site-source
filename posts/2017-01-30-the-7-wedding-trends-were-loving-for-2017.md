Planning a 2017 wedding? We've compiled a list of the top wedding trends that will be a big hit this year.

#### **Industrial + Modern Spaces**

Industrial spaces won't be going out of style anytime soon. We'll be seeing **a lot of exposed brick** this upcoming year. This time around there will be a mix of brick and modern elements such as glamorous chandeliers.

#### **Warm Colors**

Incorporate **warm tones of yellow, red and golden oranges** into your wedding decor and wardrobe. Amp up your tuxedo with marsala, also known as maroon, as a base for your jacket and pants and add black satin to your lapel. If you can't pick just one, going with multiple colors is another trend for 2017. ![](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/11/6e/2a/116e2a4c44661f777f34d563a8423630.jpg) ![](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/0a/de/7f/0ade7f4bd3f8f113b49d5431956fdf6d.jpg)

#### Small Intimate Ceremonies

Are you having a destination wedding? Or have you decided to keep the invites to a minimum? You're right on trend for 2017. **Keep it sentimental with a small ceremony.** Small ceremonies allow you to **focus on the smaller details**. Also, your guests will feel super special to have received an invite.

#### Engraved Wood Invites

Wooden invites are a great touch for a rustic wedding. They also **add a rustic touch to any wedding**. A small touch that shows you are really into the finer details for your wedding.

#### Live Band

Everyone knows a wedding is basically **one huge party**... once you get through the serious stuff like the ceremony. Sure DJs are cool but 2017 is the year of the live band.

#### ** Two Looks for the Groom**

Brides can have two looks... so why can't the groom? A classic black or navy tux for the ceremony is a great formal option and a bold pop of color for the reception is a great fun option. **Does he have a favorite color?** Go with that for the second look. There's nothing wrong with showing a bit of personality!

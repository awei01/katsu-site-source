Those burly men traditionally protecting the bride and her dowry are now throwing bachelor parties and embarrassing you. These are your groomsmen. Get them something good to reward them for a job well done- that is if she makes it to the wedding in once piece and not all your secrets were aired during their speeches before your closest friends and family. Here a just a few ideas.

For the rustic men- [cattle branders](http://www.lhbrandingirons.com/branders/steel.asp). They can go wild branding everything in sight with their initials, as long as it belongs to them.

A customized dress shirt from [9tailors](http://www.blogger.com/www.9tailors.com). Get them the gift of style while making sure they look great all lined up behind you. Add some special details to make it personal such as a monogram or contrasting fabrics.

Unique cufflinks. Although this gift is more traditional, you can't go wrong with a good pair of cufflinks. Try to get each groomsman a set that reflects their personality.

For the Traveller[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7PzUW2eiVMY/TdQGYOZqz_I/AAAAAAAAAWY/F0dFNlVx5MY/s200/traveller.jpeg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7PzUW2eiVMY/TdQGYOZqz_I/AAAAAAAAAWY/F0dFNlVx5MY/s1600/traveller.jpeg)For the Sailor

The goal should be to get them something they will actually use. Pocket knives, engraved flasks, memberships to local clubs or a beer of the month club are just a few more ideas. We might be partial, but a custom dress shirt is probably the best gift ever. Email us at info@9tailors.com to make an appointment with a style consultant! And don't forget about the referral program.

They are coming up soon, so if you think you can model, apply today! **Email your information to makiko@9tailors.com**. 

Here is the information we need: 

1) at least 2 photos of yourself- one up close, one full body shot, & the more photos the better 2) body measurements- chest, waist, and hip 3) height 4) weight 5) suit size 6) color of eyes, hair, & skin 

We are looking for both male and female models of any ethnicity. Please have a professional look as we will be shooting in uniforms and suits. 

The chosen models will receive the photos from our shoot as well as 9tailors merchandise (specifics TBD). 

Good luck!

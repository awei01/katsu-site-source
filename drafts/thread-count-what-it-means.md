[![Etienne bow tie](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Etienne-bow-tie.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Etienne-bow-tie.jpg) When it comes to the world of custom suiting, a lot of words and terms can be thrown around that you may or may not know the meaning of. Some cluelessly nod and smile when someone is giving them details, but it's really best if you have an idea of the ins and outs of the item you are about to spend a little more money on. Let's start out with some basic things you might hear. **Thread count:**  the number of threads per square inch within a fabric. [![threadcount](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/threadcount-300x263.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/threadcount.jpg) **One ply/two ply:** In the **textile** arts, **plying** is a process used to create a strong, balanced yarn. It is done by taking two or more strands of yarn that each have a twist to them and putting them together. The strands are twisted together, in the direction opposite that in which they were spun. If something is "two ply", it is double the amount of thread in a square inch. [![shirtfabrics](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/shirtfabrics.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/shirtfabrics.jpg) 2 ply, 100% cotton shirts will be your most comfortable, breathable option. A plus of cotton/poly blends is that they have some wrinkle resistance, which for some is a must. **Super count:** similar to the concept of thread count, the super count is an index of the fineness of the wool fiber and is most commonly seen as a label on wool apparel, wool fabric, and yarn. **Weft and warp:** The two ways the threads are woven in a piece of fabric. "Warp" is yarn going lengthwise, "weft" is yarn going width-wise. ![weftandwarp](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/weftandwarp.jpg)An off the rack suit will often be around a Super 100 thread count (Hugo Boss, Men's Warehouse, etc), although you can ask for a higher super count and see if they offer it. The lower the thread count, the lower the quality, you could say. Higher thread count means a more breathable, more wrinkle resistant, more luxurious feel. On the other hand, too high a thread count is overly delicate due to how fine the thread is and wears out or snags easily. A trick to see if a fabric is a higher or lower thread count is to hold it up in the light and see how much light comes through. More light, lower thread count, less light, higher thread count. [![fabric](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/fabric-1024x393.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/fabric.jpg) In weighing the pros and cons, if you are looking for a durable suit that you will be wearing fairly frequently, stick with something over super 100s, but under super 160s. If you want a more luxurious fabric that you will treat with a little more care, super 160s are a good choice. You can go higher, but again, you run the risk of a shorter lifespan for the suit unless you take immaculate care of it. So, what does this have to do with you? With this information in mind, you can know before you go and get whatever it is that you are really looking for. Whether it's your everyday suit that needs to withstand wear and tear or a tuxedo for a special occasion, you can decide what your best bet is in terms of thread count and know why.

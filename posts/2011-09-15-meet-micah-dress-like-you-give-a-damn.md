Meet one of our stylish clients, Micah Whitson. He's the proprietor and designer of a fantastic print shop, [Old Try](http://theoldtry.com/) that specializes in southern themes and motifs here in Massachusetts. One of our favorite prints? One that exclaims, "[Hotty Toddy Gosh Almighty!](http://theoldtry.com/product/oxford-cheer)" He's also the one who designed our profile picture above.

Micah never ceases to amaze his us with his taste, classic with a modern and quirky twist.  Micah is also trendsetter among his fellow colleagues. He started "Formal Fridays," where he'll wear a suit to work on Fridays (he hasn't missed a Friday since he started it several years ago). In a world where casual Fridays rule, we love that he is setting himself apart from the rest.

Getting down on one knee and asking for forever is considered one of life's most important decisions, for good reason.  Planning to spend the rest of your life with one person requires a lot of thought.  Once you decide, yes, this is the person, then you have to figure out how to ask. There are a lot of statistics floating around the web concerning proposals but the dominating theory, based on a survey done by [The Knot](http://www.theknot.com/), is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 in 4 women were not satisfied with the way their partner asked for their hand in marriage. We're not advocating renting out the Sydney Opera House and playing a symphony you composed for her but, _do_ tailor (pun intended) the experience to your partner. Show us how it's done, Raj!  One of our clients proposed to his girlfriend, Ms. Luck, over the holidays looking oh so dapper in his 9tailors suit and shirt.

The newly engaged couple radiates pure joy after the proposal.  Great job with the ring, Sir.

While we would like to think the 9tailors suit and shirt were lucky, it was probably Kim herself.  Congrats Raj and Kim on your recent engagement!

Suede is beautiful, but a beast to clean. Most of the upkeep has to do with preventing and protecting from stains. But what can be done when you accidentally step in muddy puddle, or get caught in a downpour in your smooth suede? Here are a few tips to help protect, prevent, and get your suede looking like new again.   ****Spray Your Suede**** It’s extremely important to waterproof your suede (shoes especially) during the fall and winter months. There are sprays you can buy almost anywhere but here are our top picks.   [![sprayset](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/sprayset.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/sprayset.jpg)

  ** **If You Ever Get Soaked**** If your suede jacket or shoes get soaked in a surprise rainstorm, allow them to dry completely before doing anything. Do not use heat to make them dry faster because it will destroy the suede’s soft finish. While they are drying, be sure to keep shoe forms or some newspaper in your shoes so they don’t lose their shape   ****When Disaster Hits**** If your suede shoes get dirty or damp, let them to dry completely before doing anything. The next step, surprisingly, is to use a kneadable eraser (like the one’s you had in school) and rub the stain out. If the nap of the suede has flattened after doing that, use a toothbrush and scrub it softly but briskly.   Need an outfit to go with your charming suede accessories?

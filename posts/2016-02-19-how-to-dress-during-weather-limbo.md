These past few days, weeks, and even months have been pretty volatile as far as the weather goes. Most days require some thorough research on your weather app in order to feel properly prepared. This has most likely affected the way you dress about as much as it has affected the way you feel.   Getting dressed during this period of weather limbo feels more like a chore than a constructive morning ritual. We’re here, however, to give you some tips and guidelines to looking and feeling better despite the weather’s efforts to dull your spirits!  

 

#### 1\. Get dressed under your coat

  It’s easy to get accustomed to dressing in whatever variation of your everyday neutral ensemble that goes with the color of your coat or parka. We are so used to dressing to match this outer layer, but it’s time to break free of that. Get dressed as if the weather has no control over you, and then pile on the layers. Even if you don’t get to show off that initial outfit you chose, you will feel better knowing you’re wearing what you really wanted to wear. Check out these J.Crew men for inspiration.   [![jcrew-fall-2016](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/jcrew-fall-2016.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/jcrew-fall-2016.jpg) 

 

####  2.  Mix textures

 Take a break from layering similar plain textures and try mixing it up. For example, if it’s not raining, break out those suede shoes and pair them with a textured blazer, scarf, knit beanie, and shearling leather jacket if possible. You’ll look and feel cozier than you ever thought possible.   [![limboset](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/limboset.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/limboset.jpg)    

 

#### 3\.  Have a go-to parka

 This may seem obvious, but it’s extremely important. Sometimes, no matter how much you layer under that wool coat, the wet or cold will still creep in. Invest in a water resistant parka that will keep you warm and dry no matter what. It may be boring, but it’ll save you a lot of weather induced grumpiness this season.

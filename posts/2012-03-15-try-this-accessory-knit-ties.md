If you're a man about town and like to portray yourself as such: you wear the trends before everyone else is rocking it. Or perhaps you're the type of guy who prefers to keep your style all your own: you clad yourself in whatever you deem the hippest, regardless of what's already out there. Or maybe you don't have the slightest idea on how to keep your style fresh: you wear the first clean thing you grab that morning. Whatever the case, you have your girls at [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/) to keep our fingers on the pulse of what you _should_ be wearing. An oldie-but-goodie retro item that keeps popping up on our radar? The knit tie. Sure, it had its heyday in the 80's but it's been sneaking back onto the scene for quite some time. And if Goldfinger can sport a silk knit tie, any gentleman with keen aesthetic sense and the right amount of swagger can replicate this style.

Knit ties are lightweight (okay for warmer temps), squared on the bottom, and can be twisted into a small tie-knot, whether you prefer a full windsor or a four-in-hand. Paired with a lightweight cardigan or sports coat, it's an accessory that will surely perk up an ordinary outfit with preppy panache. A great addition to your wardrobe if you're looking to do something subtle and different with your look. [GQ](http://www.gq.com/style/wear-it-now/201203/jim-moore-spring-trend-report-photos#slide=15) heralds the striped knit tie as a must-have this spring.

### The Sporty Fellow

Let's all pray for good weather this weekend, but in case it get's a little chilly keep a sweater draped over your shoulders or tied around your waist. It'll add some polish to this otherwise sporty and casual look.

### The Dapper Dude

Headed straight from work to a party? A patterned shirt and tie with basic chinos is the right look for you. The red, white, and blue colors are perfect for the 4th but still subtle enough that you won't look like a walking flag.

Looking for a finishing touch? Opt for a watch or a silver tie bar.

### The Laid-Back Gent

Here at 9tailors we love linen for summer and it's no surprise that a pair of linen shorts are perfect for a barbecue. You can get as funky as you want with your shirt, but if prints and patterns aren't your thing, a white tee-shirt is always a classic option.

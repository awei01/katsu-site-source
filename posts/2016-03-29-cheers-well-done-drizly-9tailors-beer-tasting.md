If there's anything better than a great suit, it might just be a delicious craft beer at the end of the day. So, we're inviting you to come sip in style. We've partnered up with [Well Done Boston](http://welldoneboston.com/) and [Drizly](https://drizly.com/) to host a beer tasting right here at the 9tailors studio. Local Boston companies are bringing their best brews, and you get to try them all.

What's on tap: A variety of unique craft beers from [Down the Road Brewery](http://downtheroadbrewery.com/), based in Everett. Plus, [Craft Collective](http://www.getcraft.co/) will be bringing some delicious New England favorites.

Are you an ale aficionado? An IPA enthusiast? Don't know yet? There will be something for everyone.

But wait! There's more.

Drizly will be providing $10 promo cards, and 9tailors will be raffling off a custom dress shirt. Sounds like great news for your wallet _and_ your wardrobe.

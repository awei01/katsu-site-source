With the cold weather comes layers and with layers comes the constant battle of "Should I add one more item? Should I take something off?" It can be a bit hectic in the morning when you're in a rush and not sure what to wear. A **solid chunky gray sweater** is an essential every guy should have in his wardrobe. It goes with everything and is a great basic for layering.

##### **Why We Love It**

For starters, **gray is a color that goes with everything**. Blue, black, tan, green, charcoal gray. Secondly, **you can wear a chunky knit sweater for almost any occasion**. Wear it to work with a pair of dress pants, a dress shirt in a complimentary color and a pair of monk straps. Wearing it on the weekend? Pair the sweater with jeans, chelsea boots and a plaid dress shirt. 

Sweaters come in many different fabrics, however **wool is going to be the best option for winter.** Boston's weather can be a bit of a roller coaster. It's always helpful to have a go-to sweater that you know can keep you warm on the days where the temperature drops below 10 degrees. 

##### **Things To Consider**

**Fit is so important.** We cannot stress this enough. You don't want to purchase a sweater just because you love the color. If it does not fit well you'll probably never wear it. And that's just wasted money.

**Sleeve Length:** Avoid baggy sleeves. Rolling up your sleeves is cool but not when you have to fold them up 3+ times.

**Slim Chest + Waist:** Look for a sweater that has high armholes and fits slim throughout the chest and waist to eliminate any bulk if you're planning on wearing it underneath a jacket or blazer. It can get a bit tricky because you want your sweater to be large enough to wear shirts underneath.

Keeping with the theme this week Matthew Gray Gubler has a style that makes traveling easy. He seems to have mastered the disheveled look, without looking too grungy. The loose ties and clashing patterns are all part of his charm. This model turned actor, he is better known as [Dr. Reid](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0024261/) from the show [Criminal Minds](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/criminal_minds/) where his on screen style isn't a far cry from his off screen threads. [![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1lNDw3P9g1s/TZJf99_nXeI/AAAAAAAAAKY/PdBCs0MbkFw/s320/15bmmg.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1lNDw3P9g1s/TZJf99_nXeI/AAAAAAAAAKY/PdBCs0MbkFw/s1600/15bmmg.jpg)This photo of his off screen style, posted on his [twitter](http://twitter.com/GUBLERNATION), is slightly more quirky. Mismatched socks, an easy going leather jacket, worn in cords, and a t-shirt in a neutral color complete this look. His look as a relaxed feel, which is perfect for travel. Comfort is crucial.

An imperfectly tied tie with a cardigan and jack purcells make for a less polished [Joseph Gordon-Levitte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Gordon-Levitt) vibe. Layering is also the best technique for getting the most out of the pieces you pack.

Bring your favorite leather jacket (assuming weather doesn't demand something more substantial) and pair it with your favorite jeans on a casual trip. Get yourself a versatile topcoat for those business trips.

Blue is also an option for black tie events that demand traditional attire. Email [info@9tailors.com](mailto:info@9tailors.com) if you need some help nailing down your style!

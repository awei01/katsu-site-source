With the weather we've been getting (over, and over, and over...), we thought we'd throw in our suggestions on winter gear that'll get you through New England winters!

First off, puffer vests. Outerwear vests are great for the not-too-cold days, or for layering up on those single digit days.

You can't really go wrong with a [Patagonia](http://www.patagonia.com/us/search/bivy%20vest) down vest. They'll keep you warm and have standard solids as well as some fun two-toned color options. We love the M's Bivy down vest.

Looking for a steal? This [Uniqlo](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-ultra-light-down-vest-131364.html) vest is a nice, lightweight vest while still able to keep you warm. Perfect for layering and super affordable! Oh, and they're available in every color imaginable.

Next up, coats. Here are a few reliable coats for the often times harsh New England weather:

We love this [Steven Alan](http://www.stevenalan.com/F14_PFM111026W14015.html?dwvar_F14__PFM111026W14015_color=601#cgid=mens-clothing-jackets-and-outerwear&start=12&sz=12&frmt=ajax&start=12&hitcount=31) coat - especially in this bright red. You'll be warm and never be un-findable, even in a minimal visibility blizzard!

Okay so before you jump to saying that, "Everyone has a [Canada Goose](http://www.canada-goose.com/langford-parka-2062M.html#start=1) jacket," well, there's a reason for that. If you want to sacrifice warmth for originality, go for it, but you can't really argue with a parka made for this kind of weather.

Another perfect-for-this-weather coat we love? [Fjällräven](http://www.fjallraven.us/collections/jackets/products/yupik-parka) is a Swedish company and builds their outerwear for the harshest conditions (maybe something like we've been experiencing? Okay it's not _that_ bad).

Want to splurge? Go for this $1500 [Rag & Bone](http://www.rag-bone.com/arctic-parka/d/7181C16779) Arctic Parka.

Now for boots, because there's nothing worse than cold, wet feet. Here are our picks for winter boots:

An all around workman's boot that will keep you warm and dry, these [Timberlands](http://shop.timberland.com/product/index.jsp?c=1106599&productId=11645349&prodFindSrc=paramNav) do the trick.

[![timbs]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/timbs.jpg)]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/timbs.jpg)

These boots by [Sorel](http://www.sorel.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Sorel_US-Site/en_US/Default-Start) are appropriately named...they are the [Sorel Men's Conquest Boot](http://www.zappos.com/sorel-conquest~2). Enough said.

[![sorels]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/sorels.jpg)]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/sorels.jpg)

And last but definitely not least, there is the ever-trusty Bean boot. They are long-lasting, warm and have a lifetime warranty...aka can't be beat! [L.L. Bean](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/506794?page=boots&nav=gnro-hp) for the win.

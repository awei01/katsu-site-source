In order to make a yellow tie pop, one can coordinate it with contrasting colors. People most often wear yellow with blue, but on the [color wheel](http://fusedfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/colorwheel1.jpg), yellow's complimentary color is actually violet. 

You can tone down a purple/yellow combo with a black suit. If even that is too bright, try a grey shirt. Grey offers a modern option to the standard blue or white. This look is definitely still work appropriate without being too boring!

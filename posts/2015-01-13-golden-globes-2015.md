This year's Golden Globes red carpet style was all about the glam for the ladies and branching out from the usual for the men. Here are a few that stood out for us. While he was in a more classic outfit, our favorite is this shot of John Krasinski looking at his wife, Emily Blunt. That doting face makes him look like a million bucks in our books!   [![John-Krasinski](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/John-Krasinski1.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/John-Krasinski1.jpg)   John Legend and his lovely date looked stunning in their get-ups. In a classic midnight navy tux with a shawl collar, Legend was looking extremely dapper.   [![John Legend](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/John-Legend.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/John-Legend.jpg)   Matt Bomer looked handsome as ever in a brighter navy tux. The fit is just right and it's a nice change from the usual black or more recently popular midnight navy...and boy does it bring out those blue eyes!   [![MattBomer](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/MattBomer.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/John-Legend.jpg)     Branching out from the standard formal look, Matthew McConaughey rocked a scruffy beard and a plum tux with black satin accents.   [![Matthew McConaughey](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Matthew-McConaughey.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Matthew-McConaughey.jpg)   Next up was the Entourage crew with a wide array of tuxedos. Spot the second plum tux of the night on the far right (nicely done with the black on black shirt/tie combo). The jacket on the far left is a tad more...interesting.   [![Entourage](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Entourage.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Entourage.jpg)     Who better to make a statement than Jared Leto? Going with allwhite this year (last year he went with a white dinner jacket and black tux pants to the Oscars) and loud black accents, he definitely stood out. Leto also threw in not a man bun, but a man _braid_. We love you, Jared.   [![Jared Leto](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Jared-Leto.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Jared-Leto.jpg)

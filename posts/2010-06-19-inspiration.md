I came across this photo the other day on a blog I read regularly for a healthy dose of beautiful pictures and fashion inspiration. It is [Garance Dore's blog](http://www.garancedore.fr/en/). I love the simplicity of this image and how Garance expertly captures the moment through her lens. It reminded me of 9tailors clients and fans who all wear their dress shirts differently and are able to express personality through their custom designs. It also shows just how simple and beautiful a white button down shirt can be.

Where do you go for your inspiration? How do you love to wear your white button downs?

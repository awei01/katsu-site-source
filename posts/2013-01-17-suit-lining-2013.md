Have you ever wondered why your suit has lining? Suit lining affects the overall comfort of the suit jacket. Lining also allows the jacket to breathe and allow moisture to pass through. Most importantly, it allows the jacket to move with the body. At [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/), we offer numerous lining options to make the appearance of your jacket even more unique and custom.

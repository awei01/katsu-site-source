When thinking about athletes and fashion, you think the latest active wear from [Nike](http://www.nike.com/) and [Under Armour](http://www.underarmour.com/) and advertisements with [gatorade](http://www.gatorade.com/) coming out of their pores as sweat. They live and breathe these products and garments. But what about when they're not being active? [Serena Williams](http://serenawilliams.com/) was one of the first to push the relationship between fashion and professional sports on the tennis court. People started paying attention to what athletes wore during the game instead of just how they dressed off the courts.

However, college basketball has always required their coaches to wear suits. The sharper you're dressed, the greater presence you hold on the court and the more respect is demanded for you and your team. While coaching is absolutely the #1 priority for coaches, a well fitted suit that makes a statement comes second.

[March Madness](http://www.marchmadness2014.org/schedule.html) is about to begin in a couple of weeks, round 1 is on March 18th. It is a time for betting and being glued to the T.V in sports bars rooting for your old colleges. It is also a time to keep an eye on the coaches and how they present themselves. They know this is the season to bring out their best suits and put on their game faces because if their team goes down, so does their wardrobe. The fashion during March Madness is understatedly important that [Esquire](http://www.esquire.com/the-side/style-guides/best-dressed-college-basketball-coaches-2012-7333921#slide-1) has even done reviews of the best and worst dressed coaches.

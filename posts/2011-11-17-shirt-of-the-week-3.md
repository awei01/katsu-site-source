The creativity never stops at the studio. This shirt is the first of its kind to roll through the studio. The talented designer loved it so much he decided to do it again- the possibilities are endless. Shake up your button-downs with some exciting additions like [contrast buttons](http://2011/10/shirt-of-week.html) or accent fabrics- anything is possible.

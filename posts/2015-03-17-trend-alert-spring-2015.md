Now that winter is coming to a close, we decided to put together a trend report for spring 2015. Here are a five trends that'll keep you in style for the season. **#1: CASUAL SUITING - **spring is the season with the perfect temperature for venturing out in your suit and tie, sans outerwear. Casual suiting is in and if wherever you're going allows it, throw on a pair of clean white sneakers with your tailored suit. Can't do sneakers? Try a crewneck sweater or a t-shirt underneath your suit jacket. ![CASUAL SUITING](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/CASUAL-SUITING.jpg) **#2: DOUBLE BREASTED SUITS - **oh boy, do we love a good double breasted suit. Lucky for us, they are 100% on trend and with a tailored fit will have you looking extremely handsome. They work for casual suiting too! ![DOUBLE BREASTED](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/DOUBLE-BREASTED.jpg) **#3: BOMBER JACKETS - **bomber jackets are the perfect lightweight garment to throw on when the spring weather is still brisk. ![BOMBERS](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/BOMBERS.jpg)**#4: ALL WHITE: **you heard us, all white. There is something about a crisp white outfit that just stands out in the right way. Yes, you'll have to be ridiculously cautious during meals, but it might just be worth it.

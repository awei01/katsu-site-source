**How was the weather? Was your wedding indoors/outdoors?**
"We were married in Danvers, MA, on June 2nd, 2013. It was a HOT summer day and the wedding was outdoors."
**Why did you decide to go with** [**9tailors**](http://www.9tailors.com/) **on your own custom design?**
"I was recommended to 9tailors by a co-worker."
**Describe your 9tailors experience and items.**
"It was great. Every one treated us very well and with respect, but Kim made the difference. She went above and beyond and I will do business with 9tailors in the future and probably would only work exclusively with Kim if I can. She was wonderful and it felt like a personal relationship rather than a business one."
**What was the best part of your wedding day?**
"The reception. It was such a great day, but celebrating with family and friends was very beautiful and touching. It was also gratifying to see all our hard work come to fruition."
**What is your advice to other wedding couples thinking about designing custom suits or shirts?**
"Go with 9tailors and plan ahead. You can never plan too early."
 **What is your favorite picture and why?**
"I love them ALL!"

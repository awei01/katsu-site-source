With so many different opinions about showing cuff I thought it would be helpful to break down the different options as well as the look it reflects. A few months ago the [three different fits](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2011/08/defining-fit.html) offered at 9tailors were discussed. In general, but by no means is it a hard and fast rule, men tend to keep their cuff in line with the fit of the suit.

For a roomier cut, such as the American fit, it would be appropriate to have the entirety of your cuff covered by the jacket, leaving no cuff exposed. Although, some men with a slimmer fit also prefer to show no cuff at all.

No cuff exposed.

For a European cut most men are comfortable with roughly .25" to .5" of cuff showing. This is probably the most popular style choice as it looks balanced with most fits.

A half inch of cuff exposed.

 

Following with the trend some men, usually with a skinny cut suit, show up to 1" of cuff. Any more cuff than this showing- especially when one's arms are down- tends to throw off the proportions of the jacket.

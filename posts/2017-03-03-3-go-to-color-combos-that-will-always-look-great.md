There are a ton of rules when it comes to color mixing. Wear colors that are opposite on the color wheel. Wear colors that are in the same color family. All that is great, but sometimes you have to throw all of that out of the window.

We have three go-to color combos that will work for spring 2017 as well as for the rest of the year. Dress them up for work or dress them down casually. Either way, they'll always work.

#### **Grey + Pink**

Pink can be a very hit or miss color. There are those who love pink and there are others who think that they'll never look good in pink. We're here to tell you that pink is not the enemy. No matter what your skin tone there is a shade for you. One that we're loving is light pastel pink paired with light grey. Pastels are right on trend for spring/summer 2017.

Grey and pink work well together because the two tones are very similar. They are both easy on the eyes and do not overpower one another.

#### **Green + Tan**

Earth tones will always be in style seeing as they compliment each other so well. You'll be seeing a lot more green this year, especially since Pantone named it the 2017 color of the year. Think more army green less Kermit the Frog green. Deeper hues of forest green work well for the fall/winter months.

#### **Black + White**

An oldie but goodie black and white will never steer you wrong. Of course it works for black tie events however, it also works for the office and weekends.

Black jeans will never go out of style. Pair your black jeans with a comfy white tee and a bomber jacket with a pair of white sneakers for a casual look. Black and white are both classic and minimal in their own right. You'll always be on trend with this color combo.

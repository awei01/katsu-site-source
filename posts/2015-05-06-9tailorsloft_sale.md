We've officially moved to the new showroom in Boston's historic Leather District. [Urban Daddy](http://www.urbandaddy.com/bos/style/34600/9tailors_Loft_Meet_9tailors_New_Place_It_s_a_Nice_Place_Boston_BOS_Store#ixzz3ZNPF2Jyn%20) says, "Hold still for _9tailors Loft_, a swatch-filled chamber of exceeding rakishness where you'll be measured for a custom suit and drink a glass of whiskey, now open in Downtown." That's right. We've built a swanky, loft space just for you.

To celebrate our opening, we're offering select limited-edition, super 130s fabrics at a 30% discount (two-piece suit original price: $955.00, discounted price: $669.00). These fabrics are milled from some of the world's finest cloth-makers, ensuring the perfect drape and silkiest hand-feel. Not only that, we've stocked only enough fabric to make a few suits each. So, you can be distinctly you.

Are you ready to stand out? Set up a time to meet with a Style Consultant in the new 9tailors loft at [{{ site.emails.customerservice }}](mailto:{{ site.emails.customerservice }}) or call us at 617.286.6135.

I recently worked with [Mark Anderson](http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Mark-Anderson/6744de75-e9f8-4a1e-b3a9-6088f1aa5007) of the [Patriots](http://www.patriots.com/) designing a suit and shirt for his upcoming events. While he was mostly easy going and open to suggestions, there were a few stipulations:

*   the suit must look good with brown shoes
*   the shirt and suit should be coordinated but not matching
*   on trend but not over-done

Most guys are operating on a limited selection of accessories. This means ties, pocket squares (if any), and shoes. With that in mind we set to work designing an inspired outfit to give an air of effortless cool.

After looking through hundreds of options we settled on this suit shirt combo.

We chose a medium grey which will look great with brown shoes, or black once he expands his shoe collection. The fabric also has a subtle plaid pattern to it with light pink, blue, and purple accents to make it more interesting. To coordinate the suit and shirt we played up the colors with a light purple striped shirt.

We often work with wedding couples who may have attendants in their groom or bridal parties that are out-of-state. We happily accommodate as often as we can to ensure that all 9tailors garments fit well and look great. In addition to offering virtual fittings, we decided it was about time to create a measurement tutorial to instruct and help all those people who haven't the faintest about taking body dimensions. Hope you like it!

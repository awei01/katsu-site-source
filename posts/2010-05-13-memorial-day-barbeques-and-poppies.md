I think of barbeques, and a nice three day weekend to kick off summer. But then I was thinking, what is Memorial Day _really_ about? 

After a bit of the usual web research, I discovered that not only is it a day in remembrance of those who have died in service for the nation, it also traditionally was celebrated with poppies. Hmmm...interesting. Moina Michael, a U.S. professor and humanitarian, came up with the idea to use poppies in remembrance of those who served by writing this poem:

We cherish too, the Poppy red That grows on fields where valor led, It seems to signal to the skies That blood of heroes never dies.

Moina Michael not only wore poppies but also sold silk poppies to friends and family to benefit servicemen in need. This Memorial Day, make a poppy-colored shirt in remembrance of those who have served the country. Or, go with that laid-back bbq-summer theme. Either way, 9tailors has a fabric to suit the occasion and your style. Check out some of our awesome new fabrics!

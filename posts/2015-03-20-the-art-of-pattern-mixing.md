You might be a pro at matching your solid color shirts with your solid color ties, but with recent trends gravitating more towards mixing and matching patterns, how well do you think you stack up against the competition? If you are new to this menswear fashion game you may be thinking "why not just stick to what I know?" or "why mix patterns in the first place?" We will admit, sticking to what you know is the easiest option. However, pattern mixing is a great way to experiment with new colors and patterns that you may not have ever considered wearing. Fashion is all about taking risks, and whether you're a beginner or a pro we have a few rules to keep in mind the next time you reach into your closet.

 

#### **RULE#1** [![The_Same_Pattern](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/The_Same_Pattern.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/The_Same_Pattern.jpg)

First things first. If you are new to pattern mixing simply keep things in the same pattern family. This will make your life so much easier. Although this is on the easier end of the pattern mixing spectrum, there is one thing to keep in mind. Make sure each pattern is a different size. Work in a more conservative field? This is a great way to breathe new life into your existing wardrobe. It is subtle but also eye catching enough that you will not seem like you are overdoing it.

 

#### **RULE #2** [![Keeping_it_Tonal](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Keeping_it_Tonal.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Keeping_it_Tonal.jpg)

Keeping patterns in the same color family is another great way to help you ease into this trend. This works best when you are trying to incorporate different patterns into the same outfit. For example, checks with stripes or polka dots with a glen plaid. Although this look is subtle, it shows that you are willing to take more of a risk. Keeping the look in the same tone is a good option for those who are still hesitant on taking the plunge into pattern mixing.

 

#### **RULE #3**

Have you already mastered the prior ways to mix patterns? If so, this one is for you. Use colors that complement one another by taking note of the dominate color in your shirt or blazer and choose accordingly. By taking it one step further and mixing numerous colors and patterns, you are pushing the boundaries of fashion while still looking put together. One thing to remember if you are going to execute this look, be sure to keep a neutral color as a base. This will help you look more put together and less like a child picking out his clothing for the first time.

 

#### **FINAL VERDICT**

Hopefully these three rules will give you a better understanding of pattern mixing and a few ideas as to how to incorporate patterns into your wardrobe. With the warm weather approaching, this is the perfect time to experiment. Take risks and feel confident in your personal style. Confidence is definitely key to mastering this trend. As long as you are confident in your look you'll be able to push the boundaries more and more.

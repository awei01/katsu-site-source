Then, send it to me at [alycia@9tailors.com](mailto:alyci@9tailors.com). 
 From there, the [9tailors](https://www.facebook.com/9tailors) team will judge the best submission and choose one lucky winner!
The chosen story will win the honor of designing a custom suit with their very own 
Style Consultant at the [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/) studio. 

Write it, rap it, sing it, scream it - then send it. We only ask for creativity. Don't forget to include a photo with your submission!What better way to show your special someone you care than entering them in a giveaway this Valentine's Day?

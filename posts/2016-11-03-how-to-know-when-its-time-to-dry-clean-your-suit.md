f you are anything like us you'll be carving out a bit of time this weekend to finally get some laundry done. Now that fall is upon us here in Boston and layers are in full effect now is a great time to brush up on your laundry knowledge.

We've compiled a list of everyday items and when you should give them the extra TLC they deserve. That way there won't be any more second-guessing.

##### **Suits**

There is **no hard and fast rule** about how often you should be dry cleaning your suits. It goes without saying that the more you wear your suit the more you'll need to have it cleaned. A good rule of thumb is once the spot cleaning stops removing the odor or stains it's a good idea to take it to the cleaners.

You'll want to have a few suits in rotation so that they each get a chance to air out. Even if you haven't worn your jacket as often as your pants you'll want to send them to the dry cleaner at the **together.** wwThis will ensure that everything wears at the same time.

We'd also suggest **investing in a steamer**. This is a great way to keep your suit and dress shirts wrinkle free.

##### **Dress Shirts**

Dress shirts can survive ****three or four wears**** especially if you're an undershirt guy. The great thing about shirts is that they don't always have to be sent out for dry cleaning. You can wash them right at home. Be sure to take a little time and separate your shirts by color so that your whites stay crisp and bright. Care instructions tend to differ depending on the brand.

If you must send them to the dry cleaner ask that they ****be hand-ironed****. This will cut down on all the harsh chemicals and extend the lifespan of your shirts.

A few things to always keep in mind are: wash with like colors, cold or warm wash, and **never put them into the dryer**. Drying your shirts will cause them to shrink which is no fun for your wallet.

##### **Sweaters**

Similar to dress shirts your **sweaters can withstand a few wears** before they have to visit the washer machine. Without any spills, you can wear them up to five times. Just don't be the guy walking around with a noticeable stain. Not ok!

##### **Outerwear & Winter Accessories**

Most jackets and coats should be washed **once a season**. We'd recommend laundering your coats before the snow starts. That way it'll be clean and ready to go for the winter season. If you live in a city like Boston or spend a ton of time outdoors we'd recommend freshening up your outerwear mid-season.

Remember to wash scarves, hats and gloves at least **once a month** during the colder months. Once you think about how many places you've laid them down you'll understand the need.

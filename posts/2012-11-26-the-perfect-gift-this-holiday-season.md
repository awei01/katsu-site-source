'Tis the season of giving, and what better gift to give than the gift of style? I mean, we've all gone through the painful experience of receiving an item of clothing that is nowhere near your size, let alone your taste. Why don't you save yourself the stress of getting "the right gift," and let the person you're buying for choose.

Take a shirt, for example. Everyone has their own preferences on color, pattern, design and fit. Who knows if that shirt off the rack is going to fit your buddy or loved one just right? Well, you can rest assured a custom shirt _always_ fits just right.

 Why stop the fun at colors and patterns? The receiver of your gift card gets to go all out on their shirt. Below is a custom monogram and contrast fabric on the inside cuff.

Detail means everything for some people. Check out the hidden button collar below.

Not only will your friend or loved one get a great gift that was exactly what they wanted, our style consultants will help them along the way with every minute detail of the build of the shirt and what each style is used for.

 How custom is custom? As custom as you'd like.

  With this, your giftee has a gift that he/she loves and will hang onto for a while. So, the moral of the story is, avoid that awkward experience of giving the wrong gift and go with a simple, tasteful gift that can't go wrong....a 9tailors gift card.

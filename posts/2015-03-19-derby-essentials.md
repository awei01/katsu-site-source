[![salmagundi_2015_mar](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/salmagundi_2015_mar.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/salmagundi_2015_mar.jpg) We're off to the races! Derbies are not just about powerful thoroughbreds; fashion has always been an critical element to these glamorous events. So, we've partnered up with our friends at the hat and accessories shop, [Salmagundi](http://salmagundiboston.com/), to outfit you for the ultimate derby party.

What's more? We'll be debuting our seersucker collection that evening. Nothing says derby like these crinkly threads in cheerful, spring colors.

Join us on April 2 from 6:00PM to 9:00PM at Salmagundi in Jamaica Plain. We invite you to soak in all of the springtime essentials, sip complimentary cocktails and nibble on some delicious morsels.

Time: 6:00PM to 9:00PM

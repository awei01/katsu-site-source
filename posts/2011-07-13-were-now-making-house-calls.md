If you love your co-workers or think their wardrobe could use a facelift, this is for you! At [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/) we are always looking for ways to make the process easier for our clients. We love helping people look and feel their best and want to make it more accessible. We understand our clients are busy people and carving out time to come to the studio can be difficult, therefore we want to bring the Design It Yourself process straight to the office.

Through the 9tailors On-Location Program\*, we will now be able to come to you at your office or home for design and measurement consultations.

We also have great discounts for the organizer! If you book before August 31 2011, you will get a free shirt for all of your help!\*\*

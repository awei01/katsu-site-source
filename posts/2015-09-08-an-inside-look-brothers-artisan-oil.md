With no shave November steadily approaching, as well as a trunk show hosted at our 9tailors loft we sat down to chat with the guys over at [Brothers Artisan Oil](http://www.brothersartisanoil.com/) about what it is that sets their beard oil products apart from the slew of others that line the shelves of popular stores in the area.

_9Tailors: _When did you start Brothers Artisan Oil?

_Brothers Artisan Oil:_ We started Brothers Artisan Oil in November of 2014.

_9T: _What sets Brothers Artisan Oil apart from other beard oil retailers?

_BAO: _We believe that our ingredients and process set us apart. All ingredients in our grooming oils have real benefits to the skin, beard, and hair--we use no fillers or fragrances. To be honest, there are a lot of beard oils out there right now, ranging from big brands that mass produce and use private labeling to slap their name on a foreign product, to dudes buying oil at Whole Foods to concoct in their kitchen. And to each their own, we started in a basement! But we think that we're right in the sweet spot of American/Maker Made: we handcraft our products in small batches, but in a temperature-controlled, sanitary workshop. There is a lot of love, care, and some real science in our product, but no unnatural junk, fillers, or contaminants.

_9T: _What is the best selling product on the site?

_BAO:_ The Trio is definitely our bestseller. It's a great first purchase or gift. The Tamer is a close second, however--people love its reworkable hold and versatility, grooming the hair, beard, and effective even as a lip balm and hand salve.

_9T: _Are there any tips you could give to someone who is having a hard time getting their beard to grow?

_BAO: _Don't shave! Seems silly to say it, but a major pitfall for a would-be beard grower is that they will shave in the hopes that their next beard will grow in thicker, fuller, or more evenly. The truth is, facial hair grows at different speeds on the different areas of your face, so you have to let the whole thing grow out, perhaps patchily for a few weeks, and then trim the longer parts down. Also, beware the buzzer--many a beardsman has cut too deep and ended up nearly bare after trying to "even it out." We recommend a good pair of scissors!

_9T: _Other than your beard oils are there any other grooming items that you think are essential for every man to own?

_BAO: _A good wooden comb, and a shave oil for cleaning up. Both will soon be available at Brothers Artisan Oil.com.

_9T: _Where do you see the company a few years down the line?

_BAO: _We'll still be handcrafted, but we want to expand our range of products handcrafted by us, as well as add some more American-made grooming tools that compliment our collection.

As some of you may know, we recently worked with the Boston-bred band, [Bad Rabbits](https://www.facebook.com/BadRabbits?fref=ts), designing some signature suits and shirts for one of our biggest photo shoots yet (practice a little patience—we'll roll out the photos in our Fall/Winter 2013 look book, we promise).

What you might not know is that BR just released their newest album, [American Love](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/american-love/id632332239), brimming with infectious tracks that epitomize the definition of "summer jams".  While us longtime fans, as well as other [Boston music writers can attest](http://www.boston.com/blogs/ae/music/boston-by-beat/2013/05/bad_rabbits_deliver_the_goods.html), this new LP is chock full of soul-infused, rhythmic, and downright funky tunes that are so catchy, we dare you not to bop your head. With beats inspired by a multitude of genres like soul, funk, R&B, rock, among other influences, it's damn sure refreshing to the music lover's ear.

This past April, Bad Rabbits kicked off Spring with a national tour opening for the lyric-spitting Kendrick Lamar and table-turning Steve Aoki. Just a few weeks ago, they opened up Beantown's first official festival [Boston Calling](http://www.refinery29.com/2013/06/47725/bad-rabbits). Oh, and did we mention they rocked _both _the late night shows of Jimmy Kimmel and Craig Ferguson in May? Yeah, that's right...and they killed it.

So, to provide a little preview of this album and the dapper suits we designed for them, check the Bad Rabbits performances on Kimmel below!

Like what you see? So do we.  Stay tuned for more on the Bad Rabbits when we roll out individual profiles of each band member this coming Fall! Inspired to create your one-of-a-kind suit or shirt? Contact a Style Consultant today [{{ site.emails.info }}](mailto:{{ site.emails.info }})

Chambray is one of the most popular fabrics this season. Use it in small doses such as donning a chambray tie, or for those that are more brave, even a bow tie. One could really embrace the trend and go for a classic chambray shirt. You can also mix and match chambray for a uniquely summery look. If wearing a chambray shirt with a chambray tie, make sure that each are distinctly different shades.

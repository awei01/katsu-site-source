We all know how easy it is to make a New Year's resolution in the heat of the moment. Everyone is making one and at the time it seems like the cool thing to do. Fast forward a few weeks later and you haven't stuck to your resolution at all. We have all been there so we feel where you are coming from. Why is it so difficult to stick to a resolution? Perhaps it could be that to many it is a bit of a joke and is so vague that by the end of January it is a lost cause. However, for those of you that are serious about the goal you've set for yourself we have a few tips on how to make that New Year's resolution stick.

#### 1\. Write it Down

We cannot stress how important it is to write down your resolution. Writing it down creates a greater connection between yourself and the goal you have set. It also creates a way for you to measure and track your success.

#### 2\. Make The Change Gradually

Habits do not form overnight. Therefore, they are very hard to break overnight. Give yourself plenty of time to get into the swing of your new habit. Trying to eat healthier? Commit to taking lunch to work at least 3 out of the 5 days. Once you've mastered that, try 4 days. Before you know it you'll be taking lunch every day of the week.

#### 3\. Tell Someone About It

The more people know about your resolution the better. They will be able to help motivate you and keep you accountable. The great thing about this is you may have a friend working towards a similar goal. You can both help one another and feed off of the other persons energy.

#### 4\. Use positive Language

Removing the word "can't" from your vocabulary will work wonders. Instead of saying "I can't go to the gym", think "I always feel much better after I go to the gym". Instead of saying "I can't stick to a budget", think "I will be much happier once I save up for my new car/house etc". It starts with the mind. Changing your mindset is the key to success.

#### 5\. Treat Yourself

Our final word of advice is to treat yourself. No we do not mean binge eating your favorite desserts after all of your hard work. Choose something that is not going to undo all of your hard works. Go on a mini get away for a weekend, head out with the guys to a sporting event.

Making the resolution is the easy part. Sticking to it... that is a whole different ball game. Following these 5 steps is sure to make it a little easier for you. Tell us your resolutions and what you are doing to keep them. We can always use a few more pointers!

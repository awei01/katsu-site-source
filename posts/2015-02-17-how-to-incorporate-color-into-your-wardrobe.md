  When your work attire is more on the conservative side, navies, greys and whites can start to get boring. Here are a few tips on how to incorporate some color into a dull outfit: [![shirts-patterns](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/shirts-patterns2.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/shirts-patterns2.jpg)   While your standard shirts may be white or solid blues, branch out to a patterned shirt with some color in it. Don't want to go too bold? Try a micro-pattern. It will have texture while giving the appearance of a solid shirt.   [![LACES](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/LACES1.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/LACES1.jpg)   What better place to have a little pop than your shoes? Get a fun colored pair of laces, or invest in a pair of shoes with a colored sole.   [![RED](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/RED.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/RED.jpg)   Red is a great color to keep it somewhat conservative while still adding color. Socks, suspenders, silk knit cuff links, red works.   [![BOWTIES](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/BOWTIES1.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/BOWTIES1.jpg)   A good way to be subtle is to have a small accessory as your pop of color. A tie, bow tie, pocket square...you get the idea.   [![SUITDETAILS](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/SUITDETAILS1.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/SUITDETAILS1.jpg) There's nothing quite as fun a customizing your suits and jackets! There are endless options to incorporate a tiny bit of color here, a big contrast there, etc.   Customize your shirts and suits at [9tailors](www.9tailors.com) to get just the right amount of color for you.

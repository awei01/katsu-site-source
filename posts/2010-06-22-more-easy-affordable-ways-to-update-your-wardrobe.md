 Ok, buttons not your thing? Here are some more easy and affordable tips for updating your look. 

1\. Check out GQ's Twenty-Five Fashionable Items under $25 right [here](http://www.gq.com/style/wear-it-now/201006/best-twenty-five-fashion-items-under-twenty-five-dollars#slide=1). 

2\. Instead of buying new clothes and accessories, take care of the items you already own. For example, take pants that don't fit properly to a tailor. Paying ten to twenty-five dollars to get something tailored is usually cheaper than buying a new pair of pants. Same goes for maintaining & repairing shoes- resoling and shining shoes is an inexpensive way to elongate the life of shoes. 

3\. Consign items that you don't wear anymore. Consigners such as [Buffalo Exchange](http://www.buffaloexchange.com/) will give you money upfront for your clothes. They are also one of the only consigners that takes men's clothes. 

4\. When you evaluate your wardrobe and know what you need, shop at places like [Buffalo Exchange](http://www.buffaloexchange.com/) (there is a new one in Davis Square!) to see what they have. Sometimes you will find things at a fraction of the cost of what you would pay otherwise. You'll also find cheap & chic accessories to instantly update any look. 

5\. The best way to look put together is to make sure everything fits you well (also goes back to #1). **Did you know that 9tailors custom-made shirts start at only $60?!**

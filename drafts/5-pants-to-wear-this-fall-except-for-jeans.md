Jeans are so commonly worn now that you probably refer to them as your pants by now. However, if you're looking to switch out your go-to denim for something new, we have a list of options for you.

#### 1) Wool Pants

If you have to wear a suit everyday, then this alternative may not be new for you. The rule of thumb is to choose a jacket that is the same color as the pants for a more uniform, professional look. However, wool trousers do not have to be in your typical conservative shades of black, blue, and gray. Next time you decide to order either a suit or just a pair of pants at 9tailors, try adding subtle prints to your wool trousers.

2) Corduroys

With fall coming around the corner, the rugged look of corduroys should be sought after. They come in a variety of rich, jewel-toned shades - perfect to match with the autumn scenery! Corduroys are known to be durable and insulating material-wise, so if you're wearing corduroys, you won't have to worry too much about bundling up for the incoming cooler temperatures.

#### 3) Khakis

Also coming in many hues, khakis are a great alternative to jeans. We would recommend wearing khakis when the weather is slightly more forgiving given their lightweight nature. Khakis allow you to put together a variety of casual and slightly more formal outfits. As a matter of fact, they are ideal for business casual events - you can match them with jackets of different colors and styles and still look work-appropriate!

#### 4) Joggers

Many fashion-conscious people may frown upon the idea of even considering wearing sweatpants in the public. However, joggers are different from sweatpants as they are made to be lightweight enough for you to - as the name implies - jog. If you're living or aspiring to maintain an active lifestyle, opt out sweatpants for joggers in order to encourage your body to move and flex around more.

#### 5) Cargo Pants

For the adventurous types who are already planning trips in the fall and winter, cargo pants may the best option for you. Originally designed to be worn in a military setting, cargo pants can be worn anywhere - whether you're taking on rigorous, outdoor activities or running on day-to-day errands. Its large pockets are convenient to have when you don't want to carry a bag or backpack.

As sad as we may be to see it go summer has finally come to an end. With rain and snow on the horizon now is the time to transition from those go-to summer outfits to something a bit more weather appropriate.  

#### **Lightweight Sweater + Dress Shirt**

Simple, right? Yes and no. It is easy to throw a sweater on over your dress shirt, however if the dress shirt is ill fitting on the sweater is too bulky then there will be a problem. So yes as simple as it may seem there is a bit of thinking that should go into this. For your shirt, you should wear one that is snug and lightweight. This will ensure that it will not create too much bulk underneath your sweater. Your sweater can be either a crew neck or a v-neck whichever you prefer. ![](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/b3/bc/42/b3bc42aa682bba1b865f53c5e3c2753a.jpg)

#### **Blazer+ Lightweight Sweater + Dress Shirt**

For days when it's a bit too cold to only wear a sweater throwing a blazer on will add an extra element to your outfit. It also brings a more formal element to your outfit. ![](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/09/8f/bc/098fbc27d64a9b5102cb642a8117c86f.jpg) ![](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ba/e1/2a/bae12abc8db9cf7bbbcd0e6b5cba1df3.jpg)

#### **Denim Jacket + T-Shirt**

Denim jackets tend to make an appearance once the flowers begin to bloom, however you don't have to store them away just yet. They are perfect to throw on over a t-shirt  for fall. Keep the color classic with deep indigo hues or a light stonewash. Pair it with a white t-shirt for a classic look or a darker color to keep everything monochromatic. Denim jackets work well over jeans or chinos.

#### **Bomber Jacket + T-Shirt**

Bomber jackets have been making a major comeback this year. With their nods to athleisure, they are a great go-to for the weekend.

#### **Overcoat + Blazer + Turtleneck**

Once November hits the weather begins to take a turn for the worst. Then there are days where the morning commute is nice and cool and the evening commute is unbearably cold. If you find yourself in this predicament an overcoat, blazer and turtleneck are the perfect solution. ![](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/2c/5e/ce/2c5ecea5261ace72cc7d8fb3a0dc9172.jpg) ![](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/22/af/68/22af6842d3cdf638a5d266ab2eddf79f.jpg)

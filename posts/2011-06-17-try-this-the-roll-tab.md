Summer brings the addition of more casual components to one's wardrobe. Keep it classy while not overheating with this sneaky little tab, the roll tab. Hidden under your shirts sleeve it makes its entrance to prevent excessive sweating and constant fidgeting to keep your sleeves rolled up. Yet, despite its casual appearance this tricky number can be converted into a more formal dress shirt, by hiding the tab so conveniently under the sleeves, to be worn with slacks or under a suit if necessary.

Bow ties used to be thought of as something old fashioned and only the elder generation would wear as nostalgia from their prime. It was thought to only be seen during very formal black tie affairs, on scientists and professors. Now bow ties are sliding back into the spotlight and making a statement. A man who wears a bow tie now is distinguished and confident. It's not every man walking down the street that can throw on a bow tie over a button down and call it a day. It takes coordination and flare. Mixing and matching a bold pattern around your neck with the rest of your outfit takes coordination. Our style consultant, Karly, has created a cheat-sheet for those attending our event.

Bow ties received a major push towards mainstream with the help of Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z when they paired up for their tours this past year. Don't let a bow tie be one of your problems.

With the holidays approaching and gift giving in full effect now is the perfect time to **start cleaning out your closet**. It's time to get rid of all the items that you haven't worn in a few months and make room for everything new that you'll be gifted this holiday season. There's no use in holding onto things especially when they can benefit a great cause

We decided to partner with [The Goodwill](http://www.goodwillmass.org/) for **The Put Your Clothes To Work Drive**. The drive provides gently worn men's and women's clothing to those who are entering the workforce. We all know how important it is to make a great first impression and what better way to do so than with clothing that makes you feel great.

Last year Goodwill collected **more than 23,000 pounds of clothing**, which benefited over 500 people through the Clothing Collaborative for Job Trainees, a quarterly event where individuals put together a complete interview-appropriate outfit from the donated clothing. To learn more about Goodwill and their programs visit [www.goodwillmass.org](http://www.goodwillmass.org/) and follow them on social media [@GoodwillBoston](https://www.instagram.com/goodwillboston/).

When you make a donation to the **Put Your Clothes to Work Drive** you will also receive **15% off any item of your choice over $100**. Purchase a few suits you've been eyeing or stock up on some dress shirts for the winter. The choice is yours!

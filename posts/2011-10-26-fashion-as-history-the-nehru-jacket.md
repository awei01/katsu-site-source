The beauty of custom suiting is having the ability to design nearly whatever your imagination can create. Aside from the personally designed suits we have four choices for lapel styles. The classic notched, the formal shawl, the black tie peaked, and the [Nehru](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehru_jacket).

The last option often confuses or amuses. So, I wanted to provide a little more information on the origins and appropriate settings for this non-Western style.

First brought to the limelight during the reign of [Jawaharlal Nehru](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru), the first Prime Minister of India. The jacket essentially blends the achkan and Western style suit jacket.

Wearing the Nehru style jacket was a way for politicians to seem progressive without abandoning their traditional dress completely. This endeared them not only to the more conservative crowd but also the more liberal groups through the power of dress. 

In the Western world it has been linked to a Mod fashion statement, most notably seen in the 60's, or the contemporary portrayal of the era ([Dr. Evil](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0026630/)).

Help your friends dress better in 2013 (and, give a holiday gift without having to spend anything upfront)!

From now until then end of January, if you refer a friend, you and your friend will receive **$50.00** in store credit. This referral credit can be used on any purchase over $100+.

Let's do the math quickly...

Refer two friends ($100) = 1 Free Custom Dress Shirt

_Or_, if you're the master at collecting points (e.g., frequent flyer miles, hotel stays, etc.), you can save your points for a larger custom garment!

Refer 10 friends ($500) = 1 Free Custom Suit

In order to be eligible, your referred friend must purchase something over $100 in order for both of you to receive the $50.00 in referral credit.

To participate refer your friend, click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGlnX1RsVHBNZVp4TlNqZkFsQ0FtZmc6MA#gid=0) (rules included).

\*\*Please note that prior referrals are not eligible. Eligible referral period is December 4 through January 31.\*\*

We're holding a [sample sale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_sale)!

Get yourself into some quality threads at sinful prices. As we continue to grow we need some more space, so we're selling off the samples, already-made pieces, and excess inventory! Great quality garments, that you are no doubt craving more of by now, at bargain prices. 'How low can we go,' you ask? Drum roll please..

**Shirts: $20.00**

**Jackets: $40.00**

**Vests: $20.00**

**Pants: $30.00**

**Ties: $10.00**

Now, this will be no ordinary sample sale. No tearing garments away from your friends iron grip, no rooting through decaying cardboard boxes, and no creepy warehouses. This will be a organized, not to mention civilized, affair. As men and women wearing bespoke clothing can not be expected to root through boxes of samples.

We will be taking appointments to eliminate the threat of death by stampede. These will be 30 minutes long and, as usual, you will be guided by a style consultant who will help you choose the best garments for your body, coloring, and lifestyle. She will also help you work through the racks to find which garments are most likely to fit you. We will be happy to perform any necessary alterations at cost or feel free to take it to your second favorite tailor.

Dates:

	* August 6-7, 11:00AM to 5:00PM
	* August 13-14, 11:00AM to 5:00PM
	* August 20-21, 11:00AM to 5:00PM
	* August 27-28,11:00AM to 5:00PM

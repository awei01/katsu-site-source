We love weddings, large and small. We had the chance to work with a very lovely couple, Phil and Matt several months ago on their intimate wedding in Boston. 

Both work in creative industries, so they wanted their wedding attire to be unique, yet classic. When they decided upon two complementary gray tweed blazers with matching contrasts, we were beyond thrilled! When the blazers arrived in the studio and we had posted it online, it set our Facebook feed a blaze with rave reviews!

Some thoughts from Phil....

Name: _Phil_

Occupation: _Regional Manager _

Why did you choose custom? _When selecting wardrobe pieces nothing is more luxe than custom made pieces. You and the tailor drive fit, fashion and fabrication, it is the ultimate luxury experience._

What's your best style advice? _Less is more, classic is best, don't over think it. A trend is one step away from a fashion don't._

What or who inspires your style? _You may laugh but... who was better dressed than [Ricky Ricardo](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&docid=dbniE9gNFwhZrM&tbnid=wh2gpxPm9ZyFwM:&ved=0CAUQjRw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbabynames.allparenting.com%2Fbabynames%2FFamous_Names%2FFamous_March_Birthdays%2F&ei=ON7eUoWnOKfmsAS4toLICg&bvm=bv.59568121,d.eW0&psig=AFQjCNFvv9Rq5X4M4ddLZV5Xvgr3xxc-Hw&ust=1390423986027523). He had amazing style, incredibly masculine yet very classic._

Temperatures are dropping and leaves are turning...fall is here! Here are a few tips on how to layer up without looking like the Michelin man.

**Tip #1: Scarves!** Yes, scarves _can_ be manly. In fact, they can add just the right touch to an outfit, while giving you a ton of extra warmth. Your neck, head and hands are the likely to be the only uncovered body parts, so wearing the appropriate gear will keep you significantly warmer without needing a full jacket.

**Tip #2: Vests!** You've never had a better excuse to wear a three piece suit. It's really your best bet in chilly weather. Not only does it give you an extra layer of warmth on your core, when you get inside to the heated office, you can take your suit jacket off and still look dressed to the nines.

**Tip #3: Tweed!** Tweed is a fabric made from woolen yarn. It has a rough, open texture but can also be soft to the touch. It is ideal for cold weather because it has great insulating properties. Plus, it has some serious versatility.

**Tip #4: Don't be afraid to mix and match!** Chances are, your mixed patterns will actually be more stylish than having everything match perfectly. While mixing patterns and textures can go terribly wrong, it can also go wonderfully right. Here's a do and don't example:

**DON'T:**

Mix and match that makes you dizzy. Way too much going on here.

**DO:**

Mix and match patterns, textures and colors done just right!

**Tip #5: Sweaters/cardigans!** A simple, solid sweater can go a long way. Pick up some standard fall colored knits...greys, burgundy, browns, navy...you get the point. Not only do they keep you toasty, but they switch up your regular outfits, making it appear that you have an enormous wardrobe.

Meet Allison, co-founder of [Polished Wardrobe Advising](http://polishedadvising.com/index.html). She has extensive experience in the field of fashion advising and was kind enough to share her expertise with our readers.

Last week we sat down to create a way to ease men into purple. Why purple? Well according to [Allison](http://polishedadvising.com/company.html) it possess all the greatest qualities including:

	* Versatile- looks good with dark jeans, grey slacks, black slacks, tweed
	* Flattering- with an array of shades it is flattering on every skin tone
	* Gateway- since it is though of more masculine than pink it provides a stepping stone to other colors
	* Easy- Pairs with any color shoe
	* Appropriate- still work appropriate for more conservative industries like banking and consulting

With all these perks wrapped up in one color its clearly a great choice as a gift for your loved ones or for yourself.

Take the test below to find out which design by Allison would work best for your specific needs.

Now that you know your results, here are the different styles:

Gentleman: This one is for the man who only owns blue and white. This is for the recent grad who has less than 5 shirts. This is for the guy looking to tip-toe into something different. Keep it simple with a white button and a midway spread collar.

The Charmer: This is for the guy who knows what he likes. Simple white textured contrast and contrast buttons, on the cuff only. Designing for this type of guy Allison also kept the design simple with button cuffs and a wide spread collar. We know this guy likes to work hard and play hard which is why we added a [roll tab](http://2011/06/try-this-roll-tab.html) to let him go from day to night with ease.

The Lady Killer: This is a great gift for someone who has everything. With a bold purple check patter and grey accent fabric inside the collar and cuffs, this shirt is not for a wallflower. He also has contrast buttons on the whole shirt throwing subtlety out the window. Not only is the pattern bold but it is from our luxury collection with the highest thread count.

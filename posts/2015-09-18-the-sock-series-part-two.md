**A few weeks back we dissected the anatomy of a sock so that you could pick the most comfortable pair. [If you missed it, we've got you covered]({{ site.baseUrl }}/2015/08/the-sock-series-part-one-sock-101/). Now we're moving on to the key to upping your #sockgame, which is choosing the right colors and patterns. Socks can add flare to an outfit but it only works if they're properly coordinated. Take this short quiz to unlock some sock and shoe pairs that fit any occasion.**

 **When in doubt, match your socks to your pant color. Charcoal grey pants? Charcoal grey socks. Khaki pants? Khaki socks. When the hem of your pants pull up a bit, seeing one color creates a smooth line. A common mistake is wearing black socks to match black dress shoes, which creates the dreaded bootie effects. And if you love funky colors but a strict office dress code keeps you tied to basic colors, look for a ribbed pair that will add some texture.**

**Too cool to match and looking to get more adventurous? Well then it's time for contrast! You want to make your sock choice look deliberate so reference a color or pattern that's present in another part of your outfit, whether in a pattern or in a lighter or darker hue. If the rest of your look is in neutrals, choose any sock that can add a splash of color.**

_Fashion Fades, Style is Eternal - Yves Saint Laurent_

The pocket square has steadily made appearances as it pleases, always leaving its wearer with unmatched sophistication. If your breast pocket is empty, your suit is naked.

**A Brief History**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, wealthy citizens displayed their prominence by carrying a perfumed handkerchief. Knights wore handkerchiefs as a token favor from fair ladies. English and French noblemen carried around perfumed handkerchiefs to cover the stench of poor hygiene.

The modern-day pocket square is unscented and used to wipe the sweat from a man's brow on warm days and catch sniffles during the cold seasons. True gentlemen would carry a square in his chest for style and a square in his pocket for use. However, once Kleenex was invented, the pocket square fell out of favor.

 Popular culture's influence has made the pocket square in fashionable once again. In 2007, AMC premiered [Mad Men](http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men), and reinvigorated the notion of the dapper gent.

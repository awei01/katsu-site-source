**************Meet Dr. Stanley A. Nasraway,  a kind and funny bloke who remains keenly aware that "clothes make the man." One of our most devoted [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) clients, Stan always arrives to our studio with a smile and great stories. While he occasionally ventures outside his style comfort zone to try new things, as long as it looks good and fits well, this physician knows what he wants. Sporting a suit that screams summertime, Stan is pictured above in a **************[9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) off-white suit, navy vest, and lavender shirt.  

**Name**: Stanley A. Nasraway

**Age: **58

******Hometown: ************Los Angeles,******

Current Residence: Medfield, MA

**Occupation: **Physician

**How long have you been a 9tailors client?**

Two years

**Why choose custom?**

No matter what the Department store sales staff or tailor tell you, even after fitting, "off the rack" never hugs the contour of your body profile, and never fits as well as custom fitted clothing.  Plus, at a boutique such as 9Tailors, they offer a greater selection, better fit, equal affordability, and a bevy of young women dedicated to helping one look smart and hip.

**What inspires your style? Why?**

James Bond........English, classy, not too wild, sharp fit, not a thread ever out of place.

**What is your favorite piece from 9tailors?** A black sports coat with a subtle yet distinctive sheen and a cool dark red lining in the interior.

**What would be your style advice to other men in your professional field?**

Get customized.  If your clothes fit better, you look better.  If you look better, you feel better.  Simple. I am amazed at the unsolicited compliments, at work or even in airports.  People notice the fit of your clothes.  They assume I've lost weight.  ;) 

_That's what's up! Listen to Stanley, fellas, he is a doctor after all._

Play around with colors, just because you get a three piece, it doesn't restrict you to one color. Contact a Style Consultant at [info@9tailors.com](mailto:info@9tailors.com), we'll help you pair complementary colors that will suit your personal style.

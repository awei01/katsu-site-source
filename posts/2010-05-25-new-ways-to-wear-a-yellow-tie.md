Hello all! Here is the beginning of our design board post series this week.

Do you sometimes get tired of the tried-and-true combinations, like yellow and blue, white and anything, red and blue? The challenge is to come up with a modern, polished way to wear this patterned yellow tie that doesn't rely on a plain blue or white shirt. Any ideas? We'd love to hear them! Keep posted for tomorrow's design board featuring this tie.

Here is a close-up of the pattern if you want to do some pattern-mixing...post your ideas or for those who are more daring, make a design board yourself and email to makiko@9tailors.com. It might appear on the blog!

Collar stays - every man needs them to maintain that crisp, clean look. We know you want to avoid the [floppy 70's collar](http://www.rustyzipper.com/full/174061.jpg). 

Collar Stays - $10.00

Pocket squares add a dash of color to anyone's outfit. We recommend wearing one with a blazer or a full suit to achieve effortless style. (Note: these are not hankies to blow your nose in.) Our pocket squares come in a variety of colors and materials. 

Pocket squares - $35.00.

Our cuff links are inexpensive, elegant and handy. Chose a teal or pink for a pop of color. 

Silk knot cuff links - $9.00

The Tie Thing. We love this ingenious accessory. The Tie Thing keeps your tie in check by fastening it to your custom shirt.

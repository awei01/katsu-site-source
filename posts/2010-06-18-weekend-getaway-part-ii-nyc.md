Last time, as a part of our series of Weekend Getaway posts, we gave tips for men and women going on a Cape Cod/beach weekend getaway.

This week, we will be focusing on a city only a few hours away: NYC!

Visiting the city that never sleeps in a 9tailors shirt, of course!

Try a lavender or blue with a light tonal stripe or add extra style by using a contrasting fabric for the cuffs and collar!

Below are a few suggestions:

As the days grow shorter, we are well aware of how easy it is to void your wardrobe of all color and rely on your monochromatic grey, blue and black basics.

Just because the skies are gloomy and grey that does not mean that you have to follow suit. If anything, wearing the right color during the fall will help give your wardrobe the push that it needs.

We've done most of the work for you and sifted through the color spectrum to bring you four go-to color combinations that will work for everyone.

### **Camel & Black:**

Camel and black are two menswear staple colors that you cannot go wrong with. Pairing these two versatile hues together creates a timeless and refined color combination that works for a day at the office as well as a causal night out with the guys.

Invest in a camel trench coat like the one below that is prefect for the ever changing fall weather. This tried and true color combination would be extremely hard to mess up. for a more work appropriate look pair your black separates with a white dress shirt and grab your overcoat before heading out the door. Or if you happen to be feeling a bit more daring you can don all black and allow the trench coat to take center stage. Guys night out? Pair your khaki chinos with a black bomber jacket or cable knit sweater. The best thing about the cable knit sweater is that it is thick enough that you won't have to bother with a coat check.

### **Blue & Green**

It's time to store away the sky blues and pastel greens we grew to love this summer. Fall is the perfect time to choose richer tones like navy and olive green. The olive green in this color combo is great for those who like to keep their outfit monochromatic. If you tend to stick to a navy base, we recommend investing in an olive green down coat. Think warmth! We all know the winters here are brutal. Another alternative is pairing your navy cardigan with a pair of olive green chinos. This simple fall layering technique will not only keep you warm in a chilly office, but the minimalism is great for those days when you've hit the snooze button one too many times.

### **Navy & Burgundy**

Bold and bright red and blue hues are perfect for summer. However, when it comes to the fall reach for darker shades like navy and burgundy. The best way to incorporate this combination into your wardrobe is to treat the burgundy as the focal point. We all know how easy it is to reach for a navy cardigan or navy trench coat. This time around step out the box a bit with a burgundy wool coat, chunky cable knit shawl cardigan or chinos. Not comfortable giving up all your navy clothing? Choose a burgundy shirt with a pattern, such as the one below, to offset your navy suit.

### **Monochromatic Grey**

Grey is a must for the fall. But there is a fine line between wearing all one color in a fashionable way and looking drab. Even though you'll be wearing one color look for ways to incorporate texture into your outfit. Try a chunky cable knit sweater. Pair it with a cotton shirt or a herringbone suit in a light grey and charcoal overcoat. Another great alternative is to wear the same pattern on two different scales. Wearing a large herringbone over a smaller one helps to create depth in your outfit.

\*9tailors Tip: Darker colors work best for fall. You do not want to wear a grey that is too bright. Reach for a more muted shade.

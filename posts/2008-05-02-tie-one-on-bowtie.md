There are a few reasons every guy should learn to tie a bow-tie: **Reason #1: You don't want to lo****ok lik****e a 5 year old with a clip on bow tie.** Enough said. **Reason #2: You can use the bow-tie knot for professional gain.** Ok, true story - Loo is a seasoned bow-tie wearer. He started wearing the bow-tie to impress his wife's bosses because they all wore bow-ties and he wanted to help her get promoted. His wife is now a partner in a multi-billion firm. **Reason #3: You want to balance your** **overly large head.** A tie can actually make a wide face look even wider. Balance is key. The horizontal placement of a bow-tie makes your face, neck and body look more proportional. Here is how to tie one on **Materials needed:** A real bow-tie and mirror. **\# of tries before i got it right:** Three. **Primary source:** Austin Wei **Difficulty:** Medium (surprisingly....thought it would be more difficult than that) **Best practices:** Before trying to tie this on your leg, try tying the bow-tie around your leg first.   [![](http://bp3.blogger.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SBsD23SHzWI/AAAAAAAAEcw/hk2-SyC12cU/s320/bowtie_1+copy.gif)](http://bp3.blogger.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SBsD23SHzWI/AAAAAAAAEcw/hk2-SyC12cU/s1600-h/bowtie_1+copy.gif) **Step 1:** wrap the bow-tie around your neck, so that side "b" is about two inches longer than side "a".   [![](http://bp0.blogger.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SBsEMHSHzXI/AAAAAAAAEc4/WH--_Q_mRDI/s320/bowtie_2.gif)](http://bp0.blogger.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SBsEMHSHzXI/AAAAAAAAEc4/WH--_Q_mRDI/s1600-h/bowtie_2.gif)   **Step 2:** cross "b" over "a"   [![](http://bp3.blogger.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SBsEm3SHzYI/AAAAAAAAEdA/SlOlry1mGy4/s320/bowtie_3.gif)](http://bp3.blogger.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SBsEm3SHzYI/AAAAAAAAEdA/SlOlry1mGy4/s1600-h/bowtie_3.gif) **Step 3:** As in any knot, bring "b" under "a" so that end of b is facing upwards.   [![](http://bp3.blogger.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SBsEm3SHzZI/AAAAAAAAEdI/tW2-1BskrS4/s320/bowtie_4.gif)](http://bp3.blogger.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SBsEm3SHzZI/AAAAAAAAEdI/tW2-1BskrS4/s1600-h/bowtie_4.gif) **Step 4:** Fold "a" in half, so that the end of the "a" faces to the right side side. "a" should now look kind of like a loop. Only three more steps!   [![](http://bp0.blogger.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SBsEnHSHzaI/AAAAAAAAEdQ/NlFYwbSahjA/s320/bowtie_5.gif)](http://bp0.blogger.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SBsEnHSHzaI/AAAAAAAAEdQ/NlFYwbSahjA/s1600-h/bowtie_5.gif) **Step 5**: Bring "b" over "a," so that it forms some what of a "+" sign   [![](http://bp0.blogger.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SBsEnHSHzbI/AAAAAAAAEdY/yHRq2s-kgMg/s320/bowtie_6.gif)](http://bp0.blogger.com/_RlJ3L7W6dBw/SBsEnHSHzbI/AAAAAAAAEdY/yHRq2s-kgMg/s1600-h/bowtie_6.gif) **Step 6: T**his is the trickiest part. pay attention.

*   Hold the middle of the "+" with your right hand.
*   Then, bring side "b" under the folded end of "a" using your left hand. it should feel like you went around in circle.
*   Fold "b" in half (similar to step 4), so that the end of "b" faces your left side and the folded part faces the right side.
*   Poke the folded part of "b" under the loop (center knot) you just made, so that the folded part is now on the right side of the knot.

But, the bow-tie needs some tidying up. First, to tighten the knot, tug bottom parts of the folded ends away from the center knot. Second, to straighten everything up, adjust the center knot.

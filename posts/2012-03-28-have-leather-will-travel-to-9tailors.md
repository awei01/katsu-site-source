_Co-founder, Jayme Mendal:_ "This all started when I was shopping for a leather weekender bag and couldn't find a nice one for under $1,000. I got together with my brother, Abram, who worked in the leather business, and asked him what it would cost to have one made for me with the nicest leather, lining and hardware out there…turned out it was a small fraction of what all the existing brands and retailers were charging. With that, we saw an opportunity to deliver luxury quality leather goods at significantly more affordable prices. So, I conducted a study while at school and we put together a simple new retail model, which allows us to deliver world-class quality stuff at mainstream prices. And we're excited to share this with the Boston community through our partnership with [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/)!"

Here is a subtle way to change the dynamic of your wardrobe. Work in some [colorful or printed socks](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-to-rock-your-socks.html) and you have a completely new look.

Check out the cuffs below- just turn up your pants for a modern twist on a traditional look.

Although, the photo on the far right, from [Bottega Veneta's](http://www.bottegaveneta.com/default/) Fall line, is a good example of a way to work cuffs into your work ensembles.

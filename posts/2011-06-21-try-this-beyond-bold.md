The beauty of custom is having the ability to create nearly anything you can think of. If your creativity knows no bounds, neither will your suit. One of our clients had the notion to create a suit so bold it could, literally, blind people with its outlandish appearance. This is not for the faint of heart. It takes a special type of person to pull off a suit of this caliber. Its shiny exterior coupled with a lavender lined interior creates a one of a kind suit.

Matching is fine if you prefer the continuity of a single color.

Rather than the standard four sleeve buttons he opted for the high end, sophisticated look pushed by Gucci. Five sleeve buttons with the last left undone proudly announces another level of luxury.

Let a style consultant at 9tailors know if you have an idea so preposterous it must be specially made for you. But remember, one thing that is crucial when creating a suit like this is _fit_. A tailored fit will prevent the suit from looking more like a joke than something pushing the envelope. Not to scare the rest of the suits away, we still churn out a navy suit now and then.

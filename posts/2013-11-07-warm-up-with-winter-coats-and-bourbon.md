Bourbon. Whisky. Scotch. Who really knows the difference? 'Tis the season when brown liquors enter our systems to warm us from the cold, harsh climate of New England (except that it is wonderfully warm right now for [Movember](http://us.movember.com/)).Mark your calendars because on December 5, [Brother Cleve](http://drinkboston.com/2007/03/30/brother-cleve/), Boston's most influential bartender, will be pouring you and your friends glasses of [Four Roses Bourbon](http://www.fourrosesbourbon.com/) and teaching you all about it. You'll also have a chance to preview the [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) custom winter outerwear and coating. This is a _free_ event so, drink, relax and cozy up with a glass of bourbon.

With this years [sample sale](http://blog.9tailors.com/2016/08/its-time-to-shop-our-biggest-sale-of-the-season/) underway we hope you are just as excited as we are. The best part about it all is that you can add new items to your closet while making a difference in the life of someone else. We have partnered with [The Goodwill](http://www.goodwillmass.org/) to provide gently worn men's and women's clothing to those who are entering the workforce. We all know how important it is to make a great first impression and what better way to do so than with clothing that makes you feel great.   [![2016 Professional Clothing Drive Flyer Template.pptx](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/2016/08/2016-Professional-Clothing-Drive-Flyer-Template.pptx.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/2016/08/2016-Professional-Clothing-Drive-Flyer-Template.pptx.jpg) Last year Goodwill collected more than 23,000 pounds of clothing, which benefited over 500 people through the Clothing Collaborative for Job Trainees, a quarterly event where individuals put together a complete interview-appropriate outfit from the donated clothing. To learn more about Goodwill and their programs visit [www.goodwillmass.org](http://www.goodwillmass.org/) and follow them on social media @GoodwillBoston. When you make a donation to the Put Your Clothes to Work Drive you will also receive 10% off any item of your choice over $100. Purchase that blazer you've been eyeing or stock up on a few dress shirts for the fall. The choice is yours!

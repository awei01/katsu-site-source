Here in New England the weather is getting colder. The leaves have begun to fall and fires are being lit in every living room. Winter is definitely approaching. It is that time a year again where men put a lot of their focus into growing their facial hair.

We are sure that you have heard of [No Shave November](https://www.no-shave.org/). Maybe you have participated or are planning to do so for the first time this weekend. We will admit it is a great time to try out that new facial hair you've been dying to sport. However, we do want to remind you it is much deeper than sporting some new scruff. As much as "No Shave November" has become a part of our culture many forget what the meaning is.

No Shave November is a unique way to bring awareness to cancer. The goal for the month is to let your hair grow wild and free. All the money that you would have been spending on grooming you will save and donate to charity. The money will then be used to educate about cancer prevention and aid those who are fighting the battle. The great part is that anyone can participate. Strict dress code at work? No problem! You can still take part, trimming and grooming are both acceptable.

If you do plan on keeping your beard we would recommend finding a beard regimen that works for you. Investing in a good beard oil is a great place to start! Head on over to [Brothers Artisan Oil](http://www.brothersartisanoil.com/) for all your beard necessities.

Remember to have fun, let your facial hair grow and donate to a great cause!

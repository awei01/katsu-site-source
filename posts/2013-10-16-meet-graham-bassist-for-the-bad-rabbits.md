Meet Graham, an easygoing fella with a knack for old school classic menswear. While brainstorming his [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) garments, the [Bad Rabbits](https://www.facebook.com/BadRabbits) bassist knew exactly the look he wanted to achieve. We decided to do a double breasted jacket in a brown herringbone to channel a timeless look with mass appeal. Once we decided on the brown fabric, the rest was history. The first time Graham tried everything on, he looked incredible.  
**How long have you been a 9tailors client?** 

**Age:** 31

**Hometown: **Chappequa, NY

**Current residence**: New York, NY

**Occupation:** Musician

"It's really about knowing yourself and what works for you, both physically and in personality. I find it a great challenge to go searching for garments that fit your style." 

**Why choose custom?**

"The attention to detail and the personalized styling makes all the difference. It's the best way to really capture your own unique style." 

**What/who inspires your style? Why? **

"I normally look to other musicians past and present for style points. I think musicians have their own unique way of dressing that if done right really compliments their music and creates an iconic look that defines them and people recognize them by. Some of my style icons in music are Donny Hathaway, Pharrell Williams, Curtis Mayfield, Miles Davis, Marvin Gaye, Mos Def.

**What is your favorite piece from 9tailors? **

The double breasted jacket they made for our performance on Jimmy Kimmel. I had never worn a double breasted jacket before, but [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) totally sold me on them. It's a classic look and they nailed it with the pinstripes and cut. It was exactly what I had envisioned. 

**What would be your style advice to other men in your professional field? **

"Find a look that suits you and go with it. Try and hone in on it and pick garments that really fit your own personal "brand" rather than going for many different styles." 

_Word up, Graham! Style is an embodiment of personality and signature._

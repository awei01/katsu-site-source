A few months ago, Boston wedding blog, [Beantown Bride](http://beantownbride.com/) asked us to participate in their first-ever wedding giveaway! The couple, Andrew and Brittan, met several years at [Harvard University](http://harvard.edu/), where he was an All-American football player and she was a track-star. Everything (and I mean everything), from the cake to the custom linens, will be taken care of by some of Boston's premier wedding vendors.

Since last fall, Andrew and Brittan have been busy meeting with their amazing vendors to determine all the details of their wedding. See the couple's [engagement photos](http://beantownbride.com/categories/beantown-bride-wedding-giveaway-winners) taken by [Binita Patel Photography](http://www.binitapatelphotography.com/) and watch their [video](http://beantownbride.com/categories/beantown-bride-wedding-giveaway-winners)Â  filmed [Lens CAP Productions](http://www.lenscapproductions.com/index2.php). All of their efforts will be showcased at their wedding this spring at the historical [Commandant's House](http://www.commandantshouse.com/) in Charlestown, MA.

As for us, we had so much fun with the couple a few months ago when they dropped by the studio. Boston photographer, [Tyra Bleek](http://www.tyrableek.com/boston-wedding-photographer-9tailors-meet-sam-shih/), was there to capture their first consultation. Andrew and Brittan are such a sweet couple and they could not have been more gracious! In addition to getting Andrew fitted, we also helped them personalize his shirt so that it would reflect the couple's wedding colors and style.

Andrew and Brittan's wedding colors are apple green and cobalt blue - such great spring colors! Andrew stopped by last week the [9tailors studio](http://9tailors.com/) and here's how his shirt looks on him!

We accented his collar and placket in a green and blue accent fabric

We even accented his cuffs and button holes!

Doesn't he look great! We can't wait to see the entire ensemble. Congratulations to Brittan and Andrew!

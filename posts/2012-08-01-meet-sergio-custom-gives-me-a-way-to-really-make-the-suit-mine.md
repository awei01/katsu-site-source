Are you ready for some football? With pre-season starting, we figured it'd be a good time to feature one of our esteemed clients, Mr. [Sergio Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Brown) of the [New England Patriots](http://www.patriots.com/). Read below to learn more about this handsome young man's thoughts on custom clothing.  **Name:** Sergio Brown **Age:** 24 **Hometown:** Maywood, IL **Current Residence:** Foxborough, MA **Occupation:** Professional Athlete, safety for the New England Patriots **How long have you been a 9tailors client?**

One great year. **Why choose custom?**

I love my [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/)' custom suits because with my athletic build, sometimes it is hard to get suits to fit like I want them to. Custom gives me a way to really make the suit mine and be fashionable at the same time. With all the competition in the locker room with suits on game days, 9tailors really keeps me on my game. **What/who inspires your style? Why?**

Well, I try to keep up with my gentlemen quarterly magazines, they give me ideas when I need them. I take those ideas and try to make them my own. And, I ASK SAM!  **What is your favorite piece from 9tailors?**

I have to say my favorite piece from 9tailors will have to be my white and black shirt with the checker print. I love how versatile it is. I can dress it up or dress it down and even turn it into a short sleeve.  **What would be your style advice to other men in your professional field?**

Ask Sam!  _Good advice! 9tailors CEO, Sam Shih, sure does know her stuff!_ See Sergio's photo shoot by our highly talented photographer, [Channing Johnson](http://www.channingjohnson.com/).

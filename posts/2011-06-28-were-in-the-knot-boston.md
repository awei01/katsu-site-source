We're very excited as we just learned that one of our lovely couples has been featured in this month's [The Knot](http://www.theknot.com/) magazine!

The "Real Weddings" spread. Check out the groom's shirt and vest on the lower right!

The lovely bride, Liana, is founder and executive director at [New Brahmin](http://www.newbrahmin.com/), a style and fashion blog. Her husband, Michael is the owner of one of Cambridge's newest and hippest restaurants, [Area Four](http://www.areafour.com/).

Liana and Michael were married on a farm in Western Massachusetts. It was one part part [Ralph Lauren](http://www.ralphlauren.com/home/index.jsp?direct), one part cowboy and one part bad-ass. We made classic vests in a beautiful, textural gray herringbone and white oxford dress shirts. Both vest and shirts were accented in a velvety, brushed buffalo check in red and black.

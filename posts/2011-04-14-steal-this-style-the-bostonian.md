Usually Thursday's post is dedicated to recognizing one particular male and his achievements in dress. Today, we honor the entire city of Boston for its traditionally preppy ensembles and give a few tips on how to achieve this scholarly look. Home of the greatest sports teams, resting place of founding fathers, and packed with more college students than any other city, Boston has a lot to offer. Here's how to capture the essence of Boston through your clothes. Dress shirts under sweater vests, polos with chinos, striped cardigans, argyle sweaters, navy blue blazers, Nantucket red shorts, and washed khakis are all staples in New England. Here are a few examples off the runway. ![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M27XPqH4vao/TacMju2PRfI/AAAAAAAAANA/P94NTCK0LZw/s400/prepp.jpg)

Now take the above and make it your own.

Go ahead, pair your red plaid shirt with a faintly checked pant in a neutral color. Add a timeless trench to combat the ever changing weather. Take the extra step in personalizing your apparel. Make an appointment with a style consultant who can help you design a blazer specifically made for you. Picky about fit? Your style consultant will take over 15 measurements to ensure your blazer fits like a glove. Have a vision for your buttons? We would be more than happy to source out your ideal buttons.

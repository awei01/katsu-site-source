We're gearing up for another amazing event! The [Liberty Hotel](http://www.libertyhotel.com/) in Boston has asked us to put on a fashion show for their guests! Dine at some of the Boston's finest restaurants. Rub shoulders and drink champagne with local celebs and sports stars. And, most importantly, see the collections from emerging designers, [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/) and [Lily & Migs](http://www.lilyandmigs.com/lilyandmigs.com/Lily_%26_Migs_Clothing_Habit.html). Yep. It's going to be huge.

At 9tailors we are constantly being impressed by our clients creativity. Just when you though suits had been done every which way an exceptional client will come in and request details that wow even the most jaded suit-wearers out there. Here is an example of what I'm talking about. This came into the studio last week and we thought you would enjoy the fresh ideas. [![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n2Z7Mqc93DM/TeucwLOzGUI/AAAAAAAAAX8/NmF_WZ0hrdA/s400/lionelwhole.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n2Z7Mqc93DM/TeucwLOzGUI/AAAAAAAAAX8/NmF_WZ0hrdA/s1600/lionelwhole.jpg) The vest, in a darker grey, has a pinstripe running through it in the same shade as the suit pulling all the different pieces together.

The last buttonhole on the sleeve is in a bright pink to match the two buttonholes at the waist.

Hot pink lining to match the contrast buttonhole stitching on the outside and a purple welted edge for added flare make this jacket one of a kind. Let us know if you feel like making a bold statement with your next suit at info@9tailors.com. Design yourself something different with a 9tailors style consultant. More to come! 

I would wear this suit:

*   As often as possible, I love standing out!
*   Only on special occasions, it's too bold for everyday use.
*   Once a year, just to make a statement.
*   Only for Halloween.
*   Never! I only wear black and navy suits.

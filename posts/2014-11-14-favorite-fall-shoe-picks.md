Fall is New England's prime season and we still have a little bit left of it before the holidays and winter fully set in. As we already went over how to layer for colder weather in a previous [blog post](http://2014/09/layering-up-for-fall.html), we thought we would gen you in on our favorite fall footwear.

**THE WINGTIP BOOT**

Wear them under slacks at work or loosely tied over your jeans for an awesome casual look on the weekend.

 **THE CHUKKA BOOT**

These pair nicely with jeans or colored trousers. Also, try switching out the navy laces for camel brown laces.

**THE DOUBLE MONK STRAP**

Having an overall classy look and being different from your usual footwear, this particular shoe pairs very nicely with slim cut, cuffed trousers. Go for it.

**THE CHELSEA BOOT**

A Kanye go-to, these shoes can be worn to work with slacks, or dress them down with slim cut trousers (black looks great) and a blazer. Make sure you leave the back loop sticking out of your jean cuffs...trust us, you'll look cool.

All of the above are great in multiple colors. Some key and easy-to-match-with colors would be chestnut brown, black, cognac and charcoal grey. Definitely branch out to a suede navy shoe if you haven't yet...it's one of our top choices! Happy shoe shopping!

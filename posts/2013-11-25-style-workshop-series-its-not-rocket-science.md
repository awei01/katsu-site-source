We've all been there. We have a bow tie. Then, we fumble around while watching a [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/) video. We tie, untie, struggle...but, we're still left with untied bow tie. Fear not. Learn _the knot_ once and for all. The talented folks behind the incredible brand, [OoOtie](http://oootie.com/) will be dropping by to teach you how to tie a bow tie.

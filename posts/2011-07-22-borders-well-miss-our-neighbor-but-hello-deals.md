Our neighbor, [Borders](http://borders.com/), is going out of business. It's very sad to see it go. But, there are sweet deals between 10% to 40% on everything or so it says on its windows. If you're in [Downtown Crossing](http://www.downtowncrossing.org/) today, take advantage of the deals and the air condition.

We wonder who will be in this massive space next?

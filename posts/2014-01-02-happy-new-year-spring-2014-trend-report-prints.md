You know the cliches, out with the old and in with the new. Fashion has a non-stop revolving door of trends from season to season. Whether or not you decide to jump on board ahead of schedule or mid-game, it's good for you to have an idea of what you're jumping into.

For the month of January, every Tuesday will spotlight an upcoming trend for men's suits. Until then, enjoy other menswear trends for Spring 2014.

There are multiple patterns to pick from to find the one best suits your fancy:

**FLORAL** Embrace elegance this upcoming season and mix it with structured clothes to keep a masculine edge.

**Â ARMY PRINT** This trend has come and gone and at this point, is becoming a classic, just be sure not to go too crazy with the camouflage like in the 90s. Use this more of an accent or a single piece, don't cover yourself from head to toe in pink, purple, blue, green and brown army print.

**POLKA DOTS**

I love polka dots! I'm very excited about this trend and am anxious to see this on men. They're playful enough to have limited rules about the scale and all over prints but is best to one piece.

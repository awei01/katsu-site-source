[![Marsala](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Marsala.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Marsala.jpg) Pantone has announced it's color of 2015 and we love it! Like a dusty, lighter burgundy, marsala is an earthy tone that stands out just enough. Here's how we recommend you wear it: **Monochrome** - all or nothing, baby. Monochrome is in style and so is marsala...why not give it a try? [![Monochrome](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Monochrome.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Monochrome.jpg) **Full suit** - you know we're all about looking dapper in a suit here at 9tailors, so this is one of our favorites...

Try to incorporate it into your outfit through accessories. Bow ties, suspenders, hats...you get the idea. \[caption id="attachment\_2417" align="alignnone" width="260"\][![coattreedotcommbeanie](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/coattreedotcommbeanie.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/coattreedotcommbeanie.jpg) coattree.com\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment\_2416" align="alignnone" width="340"\][![Suspenders](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Suspenders.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Suspenders.jpg) etsy.com\[/caption\] [![Bowties](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Bowties.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/Bowties.jpg)   **Saturday-wear** - throw on some marsala tailored sweats or a t-shirt with a comfy crew neck and you're good to go! Also, a casual marsala corduroy shirt goes well imperfectly tucked into your favorite pair of jeans or chinos. \[caption id="attachment\_2420" align="alignnone" width="374"\][![eastdane tailored sweats](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/2014/12/eastdane-tailored-sweats.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/2014/12/eastdane-tailored-sweats.jpg) eastdane.com\[/caption\]     \[caption id="attachment\_2428" align="alignnone" width="300"\][![gievesandhawkes corduroy shirt](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/2014/12/gievesandhawkes-corduroy-shirt.jpg)](http://blog.9tailors.com/uploads/2014/12/gievesandhawkes-corduroy-shirt.jpg) gievesandhawkes.com\[/caption\] **Shoes** - sneak the color of the year into your shoe repertoire.

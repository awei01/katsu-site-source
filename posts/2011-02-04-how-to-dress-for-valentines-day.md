Here are three ways to wear red, depending on the type of event your headed to this Valentines Day. No matter where you are going red is perfect for the holiday.

For those of you entertaining, formal style, wear a bold fire engine red tie; patterned for fun, solid for a classic approach or, skinny for an edgier look. Pocket squares to match add more interest. Pair it with a charcoal suit to avoid too sharp a contrast. Robert Downey Jr. hits the mark perfectly in his nicely tailored suit and red silk tie, and a pocket square.

Planning a romantic night in? Just want to be comfortable? Keep it festive and try a red sweater or, one accented with red. The model is paired with a collared shirt underneath, but feel free to use a plain T-shirt instead.

For a casual or daytime Valentines dates red checks fit nicely. Too keep it from being too busy go with a larger scale pattern. At the very least try a red undershirt that shows ever so slightly.

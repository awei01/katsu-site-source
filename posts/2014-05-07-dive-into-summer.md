It's finally getting warmer and that means that summer is around the corner. Is your wardrobe ready? Here are 5 style tips on how to incorporate one of the most common menswear colors (you guessed it, blue!) in a warm weather style:

Tip #1: Liven up your navy blazer by wearing it with colored denim

More on the conservative side? Tip #4: A bright navy suit will give you that warm weather look without making you look too casual

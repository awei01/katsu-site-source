Whether you are hosting a crowd at your home or traveling to have dinner with your significant other and their family, you'll have to choose an outfit for the day. Although you will want to look great you have to remember that you'll be eating a ton of food. So think about all the delicious food you'll consume and then think comfort!

Your outfit is going to have to work while you:

	*Are cooking or watching others do the cooking
	*Prepare your house for all your guests
	*Eating everything ... including gravy
	*Pose for group photos that you may or may not want to take
	*Eating an obscene amount of desserts ... every hour on the hour

As you can see there are many things you'll need to consider when you go to buy your Thanksgiving day outfit. We've put together two looks for you to make it a little easier when you peak into your closet and find something to put on.

**DO** think of something comfortable you'll want to wear, however we do not mean pull out your cleanest sweat pants and lounge around the house all day. Even if you are staying home, you'll want to entertain your guests in style. Dress shirts are great because you'll look like you put some thought into your outfit. You don't have to wear a tie so you'll still be comfortable.

**DON'T** be afraid to experiment with a little color. Burgundy is a great color for the season. Opt for an overcoat if you'll be stepping out for the day. If you'll be inside for most of the day chinos are a great option (featured in look #2). They are comfortable and will allow for a little wiggle room for after dinner.

**DO** wear a chunky knit cardigan. Chunky knits are perfect for layering. Whether you'll be home with guests or traveling to another location you'll be able to stay warm and still look great. They are also great for hiding anything that you might have spilled on your shirt #oops.

**DON'T** forget about the accessories. A scarf and gloves will come in handy when you're traveling from house to house. Solid colors are great but we here at 9tailors love patterns. Checks are always a good option.

**DO** give your footwear some thought. Especially if you'll be traveling to see the in-laws.Wearing boots? Make sure your socks match and they are in good condition. Not into boots for the day of? We'd suggest a pair of loafers. You can wear them with chinos or jeans and they'll add a bit of class to any casual outfit.

**DON'T** forget to wear what you love. This day isn't about what you wear, even though it is an important factor for most. You'll want to look good and enjoy time spent with family and friends. After all, that is what is most important.

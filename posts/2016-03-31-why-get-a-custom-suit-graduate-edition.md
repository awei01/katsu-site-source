Now that graduation is just around the corner for some, it's time to start thinking about the next steps. Whether it's grad school or diving right into the job search in your field, you're going to need a plan. Why not get started with how you want to present your new and improved self to the world? We've compiled a few tips and reasons why custom is the way to go when you want to show your best self to your new employer or school. 

One of the main reasons to go the custom route is that it will be one of kind. Whichever fabric, cut, and design you choose will be what you look and feel best in. The confidence you have in your investment and choice to wear a custom suit will show, and give your appearance an extra boost.

Pricing may seem like a scary, looming question mark for some. Figuring out how much you should spend on a custom suit is important! Custom pricing can range from $500 to $5000 depending on the quality of the fabric and tailor. 

For someone purchasing their first custom suit, as a grad school applicant or graduate, something in the $575 to $800 range will work well. The quality will be better than any off the rack suit you could buy, so it is worth the investment. Working with someone to design your own suit is also an experience every gentleman should have.

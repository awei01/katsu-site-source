With summer right around the corner, it's time to spruce up your wardrobe a bit. When the weather finally decides to break you will want to wear something that is both cool and comfortable, while still looking stylish and put together. That's where linen comes in.

Linen is a lightweight breathable fabric that is perfect for when temperatures are on the rise. We've put together a list of five must haves you should consider adding to your summer wardrobe.

 

### 1\. Linen Sports Coat

When shopping for a linen sports coat look for something that is light and airy. You do not want to appear weighed down by the fabric or the color. Opt for a light blue or an unconventional orange for a nice summer touch.

 

### 2\. Linen Shirt

A linen shirt is a great summer staple that can easily be paired with the chinos and loafers that are already in your closet. Although you may be comfortable in hues of blue and ivory, why not try a light purple? It is an underused hue in menswear but can certainly be worn with navy, grey, or tan.

 

### 3\. Linen Trousers

When the time comes to leave your jeans behind invest in a pair of linen trousers. They are a great addition to your wardrobe and are a key piece for the spring to summer transition. Feeling daring? Find a pair that is tapered and cropped that'll show a little ankle.

 

### 4\. Linen Shorts

Shorts are a must have for the summer so you'll want to stock up on a range of shades. Pick out a few neutrals such as grey and navy as well as a few brights like teal and red.

 

### 5\. Linen Pocket Squares

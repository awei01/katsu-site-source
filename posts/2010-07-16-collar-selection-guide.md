Here is our collar selection guide. It is divided into categories of face shapes. Good luck!

**Round (full cheeks, round jawline)**

Look for: collars with straight points with a traditional or narrow spread such as the Standard Point or Button Down

Avoid: wide spread collars that make your face appear fuller and wider

**Square (square jawline, broad face)**

same guidelines as round

**Triangular / Diamond (high cheekbones, narrow / pointed chin)**

Look for: medium to wide spread collars that soften your angles

Avoid: narrow spreads and button downs

**Oblong / Rectangular (long face, u-shaped jawline)**

Look for: medium (everyday) to wide (formal occasions) spread collars that give your face a fuller look

Avoid: narrow spreads and button downs

**Oval**

Oval face shapes can wear almost any type of collar. Remember, however, that you want to also keep your body size in proportion to your collar- i.e. if you are very tall and large, you will want to have a taller, more substantial collar. This applies for all face shapes.

And, as always, you can ask a stylist from 9tailors for personal collar advice.

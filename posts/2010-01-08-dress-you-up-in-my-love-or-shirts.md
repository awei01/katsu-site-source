I'm a child of the 80's. So, this accounts for my small obsession with over-sized shirts over leggings and bright colors. The other day while we were busy working in the studio, trying to work out the final details of our Valentine's Day custom dress shirt event, Celia (brilliantly...might I add) re-discovered Madonna's song, _Dress You Up_ _in My Love._ Perfect!

While we won't be offering cropped shirts or crazy bejeweled jackets, we will be giving couples the chance to experience the 9tailors's signature custom design process. You will design a shirt for your valentine. Your valentine will design a shirt for you. Both of you will receive a 20% discount on our Premium and Luxury Collections.\* That means that you get a $90.00 shirt for $72.00! But, if you feel like that's a little out of your budget, then we also have less expensive fabric for $60.00. Most shirts will be done by Valentine's Day!

**Grass:**

Soak white clothes in full strength vinegar for 30 minutes before laundering.

**Tomato, Oil, & Fat:**

Pour boiling water through the stain (from the back side) in a bowl. Or, iron fats-based stains on high heat on the opposite side of the stain to melt it out. Use cornflour or baking soda to help absorb the stain before and after heat.

**Wine:**

If you have a red wine stain, and there is white wine handy, pour some white wine over your stain. White wine neutralizes the red wine. Or, blot the stain with vinegar. Another option is to use a course salt such as Kosher or sea salt to lift the stain.

**Fruit:**

Squirt lemon onto the stain. Then, use plain white bar soap such as Ivory to rub out the stain.

**General:**

Follow the recipe below and use to spot treat stains and soak overnight. Remember never to put a stained item of clothing in the dryer; that will set the stain.

2 parts hot water

1 part baking soda

1 part hydrogen peroxide

Pantone has announced it's color of 2015 and we love it! Like a dusty, lighter burgundy, marsala is an earthy tone that stands out just enough.

Here's how we recommend you wear it:

**Monochrome** - all or nothing, baby. Monochrome is in style and so is marsala...why not give it a try?

**Full suit** - you know we're all about looking dapper in a suit here at 9tailors, so this is one of our favorites...

**Accessories** - don't want to splash out on the full body color? Try to incorporate it into your outfit through accessories. Bow ties, suspenders, hats...you get the idea.

**Saturday-wear** - throw on some marsala tailored sweats or a t-shirt with a comfy crew neck and you're good to go! Also, a casual marsala corduroy shirt goes well imperfectly tucked into your favorite pair of jeans or chinos.

**Shoes** - sneak the color of the year into your shoe repertoire. They'll pair great with navy, tansÂ and other earthy colors.

Just because it's getting dark outside doesn't mean you need to swap all of your colorful items for drab greys and bleak blacks. Anchor your lighter pieces with a darker contrast like one of our clients did below. A pink shirt doesn't need to be reserved for the spring and summer when paired with navy buttons and navy contrasting fabric.

This also works great if you just do a bright button on the cuffs for a more subtle approach.

He didn't want to stop at the collar and cuff but opted for contrasting fabric down the placket as well. This is a great option for a more casual look.

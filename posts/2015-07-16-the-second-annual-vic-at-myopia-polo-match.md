Get ready, ladies and gentlemen, because the VIC at Myopia Polo Match is here! Hosted by Myopia Hunt and Polo Club in South Hamilton, MA, August 2nd promises to be a fun-filled afternoon of field-side cocktails and polo in support of a great cause.

The Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center (VIC) at Massachusetts General Hospital is working to speed up the development of vaccines to fight cancer, diabetes, and other dangerous diseases. If you would like more information about VIC and the power of raising awareness through this charity event click [here](https://giving.massgeneral.org/polo-match-supports-innovative-vaccine-research/).

Alex Ingram, co-founder of A Boston Blazer, and Elizabeth Stankus, a recent graduate of Parsons School of Design, are at the head of the event, so it is guaranteed to be a stylish affair. Last year their hard work really paid off and the event was a huge success. Not only did a slew of people show up, but they raised just under $10,000! Here are some pictures from last year’s event. The theme was “A Thomas Crown Affair”.

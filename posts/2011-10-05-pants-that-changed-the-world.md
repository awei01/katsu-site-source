Fads come and go but some make an impression that lasts. Check out the pants that changed the world, even if their brightest moment was fleeting-thankfully.

Probably the most memorable pants are those that [MC Hammer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Hammer) famously flaunted.

Their unflattering silhouette makes for a diaper inspired look even on the most toned bodies. These should only make an appearance on Halloween.

Another fad tragedy was [Zubaz](http://www.zubaz.com/). Created by a couple wrestlers on the road who wanted something more comfortable, and fashionable, to work out in these pants took the world by storm. Usually worn with a mullet and equally ostentatious shirt these pants guarantee to please even the most discerning of fashionistas.

The most recent of the three would be this...[Sagging.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagging_(fashion))

Why must boys show off their underwear? There is nothing flattering, or practical, about wearing your pants well below your backside. And, why is he wearing a belt?

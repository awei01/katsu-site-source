_"Our Bespoke line is reserved for those with a greater knowledge and desire for unique products of superior quality - individuals who seek out the "one-of-a-kind"  With Bespoke shoes, a pair of lasts are made to exacting measurements of your feet. Every bend and curve, the unique shape of your foot, is taken into consideration. You have input into the development of a toe shape and heel height to best suit your personal style." _\- Peter Feeney

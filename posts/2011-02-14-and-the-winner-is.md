We were so moved by the story Jason's wife, Olivia, wrote to us. Here's a small excerpt from Olivia's nomination. Olivia writes:

_Meet Jason. He's the guy our little girl is running to greet at the door. The guy that lights up our home with his good-natured personality.  The guy that makes this house a home.  You've probably met men like Jason before. Maybe you've even overlooked them. They seem to have it all together. The charming smile, the pleasant demeanor, the classy sense of style.  (Most of us don't have a chance to peek inside their closets. If we did, we'd probably be surprised at how they make do with so little.)_

Thank you, Olivia!

Everyone had such amazing stories to tell. It was _very_ difficult to choose just one. So, we would like to give a special thanks to all of you who entered in our Valentine's Day Giveaway. It was such a pleasure reading everyone's heartfelt stories on the day/week/month that we celebrate love. What a fantastic reminder of how many amazing people there are in our lives.

Happy Valentine's Day everyone!

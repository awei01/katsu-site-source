My choice would be Alice Lu, hands down. It's a treasure trove of [Chanel](http://www.chanel.com/) handbags, [Marc Jacobs](http://www.marcjacobs.com/) coats, [Prada](http://www.prada.com/) heels, and a Badgley Mischka gown (more on that below). Sadly though, I have never taken a peek into Alice's closet (she would ****never**** reveal the secrets of her wardrobe. ****She's a l********ady**** for goodness sakes!). What a pity because I'm sure I would be dazzled. From casual stroll in Copley Square to a special occasion at the top of the hub, Alice is always appropriately dressed for every occasion. She is always refined, alluring, and youthful. One important note: Alice cleans out her closet every year and sells them at the store, [Second Time Around](http://www.secondtimearound.net/). So, if you're lucky enough, you might be able to score some of Alice's gently worn clothes there. **Sam:** Define your personal style. **Alice:** I'd like to think my personal style is chic and trendy, but most importantly, always elegant.

Having said that, I think it's unlikely that in this lifetime, I'll ever be caught wearing anything resembling camouflage. **Sam:** What or who inspires you? Why? **Alice:** I don't have a particular source of inspiration, but my favorite style icon is Audrey Hepburn. She always looked so effortlessly elegant and chic, but her beauty was very approachable and not artificial. **Sam:** What is your worst-ever fashion-faux pas? **Alice:** Hmm... in middle school I went through a phase where I wore t-shirts in only large or x-large (I'm relatively petite and about 5'3"). I actually had an entire stack of huge shirts in bright colors that I wore with pants, jeans, even mini-skirts. does this count as a fashion faux pas? If not, it's still embarrassing enough when I see old pictures... **Sam:** What's the coolest thing you own in your closet?[![](http://i1.tinypic.com/nqzj3q.jpg)](http://i1.tinypic.com/nqzj3q.jpg) **Alice:** Well, clothing circulates through my closet pretty quickly, but I think the coolest thing I have currently is this gorgeous black [Badgley Mischka](http://www.badgleymischka.com/) evening gown (a similar Badgley Mischka dress pictured right). I haven't even really worn it, but it was one of those dresses that I tried on for fun and couldn't help taking home, even though I have no idea when I'll wear it. **Sam: **Can I borrow that dress if you're not going to wear it? **Alice:** Umm...  **Sam:** How would you wear a button-down dress shirt? **Alice:** I've worn dress shirts in various ways, depending on what phase I'm in, but right now, I like a crisp button-down dress shirt tucked in to pants with a thin metallic or brightly-colored belt through the belt loops.

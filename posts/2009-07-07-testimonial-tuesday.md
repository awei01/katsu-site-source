Here's what a few of you had said about 9tailors:

"I wanted to thank you personally for the excellent experience. The shirt is simply full of awesome. The softness of the collar and the cuffs are is what I had hoped for, the texture and color look classy, and the fit is fantastic. Absolutely no complaints. " - K. Mo, Boston 
"They are amazing." - Michael, Boston

"I just would like to say I was quite impressed by the 9tailors's operation. From the beginning with the customized measurements to the numerous options on the website which was very professionally done; I felt as though I was getting a worthy product and I did. The shirt was great it fit well and looked fantastic which I figured since I received many comments from the ladies." - Jarrod, Boston

"The shirt I just ordered fit like a glove. Probably the best fitting shirt I've ever gotten! The process was amazingly simple with great customer service when questions arose. Buy with confidence (over and over and over)! I can't wait until my next order." - Chris, Hartford

"I was a little skeptical about buying from an online site, but had heard a lot of good reviews from friends who bought from 9tailors. The shirt came promptly and neatly packaged. I was really happy with the quality and thought the shirt looked better than the picture online. I don't usually get comments from other people about my clothing, and was surprised when two people told me how much they liked the shirt the first time I wore it. I will definitely be buying from them in the future." - Max, Boston

"My pink shirt was a big hit, with over 5 nice comments just in my first day wearing it. I wouldn't usually try to pull off such a color, but I knew with the quality of 9tailors that it'd all be okay. Thanks!" - James, Boston

"Your customer service was great. I enjoyed the whole process." - Dave, Boston

"We love all of the different styles of custom shirts that 9tailors offers their customers, and that we can offer our clients! From your choice of french cuffs to chevron pockets, anyone can really build a dream shirt. These make wonderful groomsmen gifts because with only a few measurements, they get a stylish shirt that fits them perfectly. We highly recommend 9tailors to anyone." - Pink Orchid Weddings

Meet Christopher Cuozzo, fashion-forward client, style entrepreneur, and an all-around swell guy. [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) caught up with this dashing young lad recently to discuss his philosophies on menswear and his pocket squares, available for purchase in mid-June right here in our studio! Take it away, Mr. Cuozzo. **Occupation:** Founder of [Dressed By Christopher Cuozzo](http://www.dressedbycc.com/), a clothing e-tailer  **Hometown:** Born and raised in Woburn, MA **Current Residence: ** Woburn, MA  **Age:** 30

**Tell us about your philosophy on pocket squares.**

Details, details, details!   It’s what gets you noticed in all the right ways. Something as simple as a $20 pocket square can make the difference between looking awesome and looking just okay.  You don’t have to spend a ton of money to look like a million bucks.

**Do you have a favorite pocket square that you are sending to 9tailors?**

Yes, the navy/white 1/8" gingham, 100% cotton. It's so classic, it goes with so many shirt and tie combinations, and gingham is _so_ New England. You simply can't go wrong with it. Simple, yet makes a statement that you're aware of details and make a small effort in dressing yourself. 

**Why choose custom clothing over off-the-rack menswear?**

The biggest most important word in menswear is that three letter F word – FIT.  This is where so many guys go wrong! You’re not rowing a boat in your suit, so it’s okay to have it not fit like a windbreaker. Your pant length should not have a full break, nor should the crotch go halfway down your thigh. Your jacket sleeves should not even come close to hitting your knuckles, nor should they be able to accommodate Hulk Hogan’s biceps, even if you’re built like Michael Phelps. And there’s no need for a man’s suit jacket to allow room for a pregnancy – men can’t get pregnant! Custom alleviates all of these ill-fitting attributes. Custom can separate you from the herd. About a year and a half ago, I had [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) make me a custom short sleeve French cuff shirt. To this day, I’ve never seen anyone else wear one, yet, I receive tons of compliments when I wear it.

**Describe your experience with 9tailors.** Spectacular. I first met Sam Shih in 2009 and was greeted with a glass of champagne and world class service.Sam and her team have a wide range of knowledge and it shows. Upon request only, they email me fabric swatches. If I see something I like, I book an appointment and go to their Boston studio to get a feel for it.[9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) is fantastic service (without that annoying salesperson who follows you around the department store trying to push last season’s inventory). **What's your fashion advice to other guys out there?** **Color.**  Do not fear color.  Black is for funerals and formal events.  So many guys reach for blues, whites, and black because that’s what’s safe.  Stop being a wallflower and consider light pink, red, orange, purple, yellow, etc. You can start off slow with a light pink shirt or even a light pink tie or pocket square.  I’m not saying that guys need to wear fuschia colored shirts...start off with muted pinks to ease yourself into new colors. **Patterns.** There’s more to fabric than just solids.  Consider a pinstripe suit, or a paisley pocket square, or a bold silk repp tie, or a gingham dress shirt.  Don’t be afraid to go pattern on pattern.  Rules were made to be broken.  Wearing a solid suit with a paisley tie on a checkered shirt is a great way to make an impression.  Not everything has to match.  As a matter of fact, steer clear of ties that come with matching pocket squares, or at least don’t wear them together.  You don’t want to look too “matchy” or as if you’re trying too hard. _Couldn't agree with you more, Christopher! _

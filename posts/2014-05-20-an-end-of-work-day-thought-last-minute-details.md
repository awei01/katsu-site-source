You're day is almost over and you're thinking about going home or getting food. You're not going to have to think about work until either after dinner or when your alarm goes off tomorrow morning. If you hit that snooze button too many times, you're going to end up running out the door to catch the T that closes its door as soon as you step onto the platform. Chances are, you grabbed the first thing you saw and threw it on - but what if it's the same suit you wore yesterday?! You have to make it look different and distract people from noticing and if you're lucky enough, it's a gray suit that everyone has.

Possible solutions to having to wear the same suit 2 days in a row

	*Wear a \*noticeably different shirt. If you wore white, wear color. If you wore color, wear a pattern or white.
	*Add, subtract or change accessories  (throw in a pocket square, wear a bow tie instead of a tie)

Ultimately, your goal is to put together a last minute outfit that no one will notice is the main pieces are the same as the previous day - it's all about drawing attention to the details instead of the whole generic suit.

\-And don't forget, you can always mix and match or wear your suit as separates

This Spring season is all about blue. We have seen a decent amount of blue suits come in with more on the way but if you're not ready for a full blue suit (not navy - blue), then use a pocket square or tie to stay up to date and keep your suits from looking stale.

If blue is still too much for you, there's always the classic white pocket square. There are ways to play around with that, too though, so don't count it out all together as 'too basic'. A linen pocket square will keep things casual while a silk pocket square will nod to an elegant gentleman. A silk pocket square with a contrasting trim will say you pay attention to detail and don't need excess flash to put your look together, you know what you're doing. And last but not least, a white on white pattern - my personal favorites. The subtle details aren't noticed from a far but when you're up close and talking to someone, their eye will be drawn to the your pocket square as it breaks up the monochromatic suit but be pleasantly surprised by the hidden-in-plain-sight polka dots.

How are you celebrating your New Years? One of our favorite bands, [Bad Rabbits](https://www.facebook.com/BadRabbits), winner of [Boston Music Awards](http://www.bostonmusicawards.com/) Artist of the Year, will be playing at [The Sinclair](http://www.sinclaircambridge.com/). If you're one of the lucky ones, you already got your tickets because they're sold out!

Allow me to introduce Bad Rabbits member, Sheel; an inquisitive and bright young man with a definitive taste.

When we met Sheel, we talked about what he wanted for fit, function (the man is the bad-ass drummer for [Bad Rabbits](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2013/09/bad-rabbits-closer-look.html)) and look of his suit. We decided on a design inspired by Bruno Mars, a ticket pocket, black trim and single besom pocket lips. The black accents make the grays pop and ties the three piece suit together. The man has style, accessorizing with a gray bow tie, a black button down and hat, there's no denying him urbane character. Sheel arrived to the studio with a variety of ties to pair with his ensemble, and stepped out of the dressing room looking more dapper than we could have imagined.

Of course bow ties are the better option for three piece suits. Sheel knew what he was doing when he designed his suit.

**Step 5:** Now that everything is organized and you've got a list of what you need, time to shop! 

For virtually any work atmosphere and for both genders, dress shirts are always acceptable if not a work staple. But that doesn't mean that your dress shirts need to be boring! With over 700 fabric samples and dozens of style choices, you will never look exactly the same as that guy next to you while wearing a shirt from 9tailors. Your shirt will be made to order to fit your body, your lifestyle, your budget, and your taste.

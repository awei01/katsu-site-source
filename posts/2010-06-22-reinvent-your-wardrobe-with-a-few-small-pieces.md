Do you want to look more elegant or dashing yet not go broke? Here's a tip you may not have thought of!

Most clothing comes with cheap plastic buttons. Replacing these buttons (think on blazers, suit jackets, coats, blouses & dress shirts) can instantly update your existing wardrobe pieces and make them look more expensive. Depending upon the buttons you choose, it can also give your item of clothing a whole new personality. If you can do it yourself or have a handy friend, replacing buttons isn't too difficult and you'll only be paying for the cost of a few buttons. If you can't do it at home, it isn't an expensive job to get done at the tailor, either.

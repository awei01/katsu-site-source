This is pretty much the last weekend to do your holiday gift shopping. Christmas is about a week and a half away. Sales are passing by and quantities are becoming limited. Lucky for you, our 20% off purchases over $150 promotion goes until December 26th and our Holiday Male Box gets you 10% off 9tailors accessories and custom shirt gift cards\*restrictions apply until the end of the year.

Our holiday gift guide is for those who are looking to buy men's suiting accessories to help build up your man's wardrobe to become a tad bit more dapper. If you get him a tie, don't just get him a tie. Get him a tie _and_ a tie-holder. This will show that you thought about the gift a little more rather than just grabbing a tie that you hope he likes but also help keep the tie in place during his day. If you get him a bow tie, pair it with a pocket square or knotted cuff links. Knotted cuff links are the perfect starter cuff links for someone who isn't entirely sure of them. They are casual yet styled and the best part is that they are inexpensive. They come in array of colors to match up with their colored shoe laces or shirts.

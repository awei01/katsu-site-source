Meet our clean cut client, Kenneth. Kenneth is a big fan of dressing to impress despite the fact that the majority of men in his profession tend to stick to khakis.  He regularly bucks the norm with daring lining options and colorful ties. Read more about our favorite scientist below.  

**Name**: Kenneth Lawrence
**Age**: do I really have to? 46
**Hometown**: Norfolk VA
**Current Residence**: Norfolk, MA
**Occupation**: Senior Medical Scientist

**How long have you been a 9tailors client?** About 3 years

**Why choose custom?** Simple, because the fit is amazing. Choosing a shirt off the rack can always be an adventure for anyone even a "normal size" person. You never really know your size and even when you do you never get the shirt to fix the way it should. Sometimes the sleeves peek out just right when you wear a jacket but when you take off the jacket there is too much material sticking out in back or on the sides; not a great look. Other times, the body of the shirt is just too big and it looks awful. A well design custom made shirt should be in the closet of any man that cares about the way they present themselves to others.

**What would be your style advice to other men in your professional field?** Just because you are a scientist you do not have to wear jeans or khakis every day. Sure, Fridays can be jean day and Wednesday wear khakis, but once in a while, wear shoes with leather soles, a pressed shirt and a pair of wool slacks. Socks should match and shine your shoes (it's cheap) too.

**What/who inspires your style?** Myself and my dad. I would honestly rather help a women choose a dress or accessory (what does that say about me?) than worry about being inspired by anyone else. That said, I like a classic look which includes a pressed 9tailors shirt, wool slacks and a colorful tie to match. As for looks, I like the "Mad Men" style without the skinny ties. A tailored, well fitting, well groomed man looks intelligent, feels confident and gives you a leg up on the next guy…… sometimes.

**What is your favorite piece from 9tailors?** All of them. But probably my suit with the custom zebra lining; no one can top that. Sam, Alex, and Kathryn, make the fitting and all aspect of getting custom made clothes a great experience.

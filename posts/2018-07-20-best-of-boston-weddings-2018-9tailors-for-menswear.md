_"9Tailors in Boston, MA is beyond amazing! They offer a unique experience with a classy studio/boutique style location in the City. The hospitality and service is exceptional, it really is like no other. The staff takes their time to listen and discover what you really want in a suit, and they offer many options, suggestions, and styles. I used 9Tailors for my destination wedding down in Florida which was in June so I was worried that it maybe to hot to have my groomsmen wear suits in the 95 degree weather. Luckily Sam and her team shared different fabric styles with me such as Sharkskin, and linen that were light, stylish, and perfect for a summer/beach wedding. The guys and I had a fun time drinking a nice glass of whiskey, sharing stories, picking out our suits and getting fitted for the big day. For someone who owns a handful of suits I never realized how much more can be done, then I discovered 9Tailors. They have an amazing process of building a suit from top to bottom, giving you the option to choose from numerous amounts of linings, stitches, etc... You know you have quality suits when your Best Man is out of town and does a virtual suit fitting and calls you and says, "Fits like a glove." Thank you guys for amazing service, and fresh quality suits!" -Christ ([The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/9tailors-boston-ma-449981))_

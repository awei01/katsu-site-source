**What are your names?** David Rogers & Dan Ferrell **Where and when was the big day?** October 20, 2012 at the Harvard Faculty Club, Cambridge, MA **How was the weather? Was your wedding indoors/outdoors?** Beautiful. 71 degrees and sunny. A perfect fall day and a beautiful day to have an outdoor wedding. **Why did you decide to go with 9tailors on your own custom design?** I decided to go with 9tailors because I knew I didn't want to rent my tux and I wanted to perfect tux for my wedding. I figured I would have to have any tux I bought tailored to fit me perfectly so I thought - why not have a tux actually made to fit me perfectly the first time around. **Describe your 9tailors experience and items.** I came to 9tailors with a picture and Alex took it from there. It was so nice to have someone knowledgeable about style and fit. I trusted Alex from day one. The service was great and I couldn't be more happier with my tuxedo. Thank you 9tailors. **What was the best part of your wedding day?** Having it outdoors. We had always anticipated having the ceremony inside since it would be so late in October. But the weather cooperated and by 12:00 that afternoon the chairs were moved outside. It couldn't have been a more beautiful day. We had an a cappella group from Harvard sing during the ceremony which we kept as a surprise from our guests. They were fantastic and added so much to the day. **What is your advice to other wedding couples thinking about designing custom suits or shirts?** Trust the folks at 9tailors. They really listened to my ideas and what I liked. They are professionals so when I had a question I just asked them what they thought and they didn't steer me wrong. **Choose your favorite photo and tell us why.** I think they are all my favorite. I keep replaying the day over and over again in my mind and I tried hard to take it all in. But I really like the one with that just shows are legs (and my red socks).

Meet my good friend, **Allison Abrams, ** co-owner of [****Polished****](http://www.polishedadvising.com/)_,_ a wardrobe advising company. Ally has an eagle-eye when it comes to buying designer labels and looks for less, which is why she is so successful at helping others build their own wardrobes. I have seen her rifle through racks of clothes at H&M with the precision of a swiss timepiece. Surprisingly, each time, she emerges with a fabulous outfit, from outwear to underwear. She also has an understated, yet elegant style. When I first met Ally, she had on a fabulous tailored jacket with a belt that was cinched at the waist, wide-legged trousers, and an over-sized leather bag. This is one girl knows how to do menswear right.

I found at Filene's basement (I'm big on designer clothing at bargain prices) – it's double breasted with sparkly, crystal cluster buttons and a matching belt that fastens in the most creative way.  **Sam:** What/who inspires you? Why? **Ally:** My mother – she always looks beautifully pulled together, whether she's wearing a suit or sweats. she claims i have shaped her style, but i know it's in fact the reverse. **Sam:** What is your worst-ever fashion-faux pas? **Ally:** Think middle school – clunky doc martins, big plastic rings on every finger. I like to tell myself these things were in style back in the day.

Why? **Ally:** Too tough to choose just one – it's a toss-up between Sarah Jessica Parker (her personal wardrobe, not her Sex and the City character's) and Reese Witherspoon (pictured left). Their styles are both incredibly elegant and vibrant... and they always look impeccable on the red carpet. Lately, I'll admit it, I also love everything Katie Holmes has been wearing! **Sam:** How would you wear a button-down dress shirt?  **Ally:** I love a fitted shirt worn untucked with a fabulous belt at the natural waist – right now I am into crackled metallics, braided silks, and cognac colored leathers.

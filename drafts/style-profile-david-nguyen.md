## Meet David

### Describe your style.

Modern.

### Where do you get your style inspiration?

Magazines and movies.

### What is your favorite 9tailors garment? Tell us why. How do you accessorize your outfit?

A light blue dress shirt with mitered French cuffs.

### What advice would you give to someone who is trying custom tailoring for the first time?

Understand that your very first item may take a few times to get the exact right fit.

### Why did you choose 9tailors?

First, as a reference. But now, I find the shirts to be excellent quality - the cuffs and collars don't shrink like previous custom shirts made from a competitor.

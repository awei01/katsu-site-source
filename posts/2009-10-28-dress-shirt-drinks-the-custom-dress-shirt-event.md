You're invited to our Dress Shirts and Drinks custom event! 
If you've been itching for another fabulous custom dress shirt event, you're in luck. We've moved to a new studio in Boston's Financial District and we're celebrating with a two-day trunk show! There will be a happy hour reception on **Friday, November 13 from 4:30 PM to 8:00 PM, with a weekend reprise on Saturday from 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM**. Enjoy wine and beer, mingle with other style mavens, and experience 9tailors's signature custom design process at its very best!

At the event, a fitter will be on hand to measure clients for accurate fit through the body. Then, style consultants will help clients choose from hundreds of fabrics and design options to suit a range of styles and tastes. As always, our shirts start at $60 and come with the promise of a perfect fit or your money back guaranteed!

To thank our clients for making 9tailors bigger and better, we're offering a special promotion. Bring a friend to the event and you'll both get 10 percent off your orders. If the guest is female, 9tailors will boost the discount to 20 percent! Orders from this event will be ready in time for the holidays. Please note that this offer cannot be combined with other offers. This discount only applies if you and your friend both purchase a full-priced dress shirt.

Reserve a fitting at the event by e-mailing: [{{ site.emails.info }}](mailto:{{ site.emails.info }}).

We can't wait to see you there!

P.S. Our new studio also comes with new hours! You can now visit us Mondays through Wednesdays from 12 to 5 PM and Thursdays and Fridays from 12 to 7 PM. Additional appointment times are available upon request.

While [velvet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet) is a serious trend for winter fashion,did you know that the soft, luxurious fabric carries over into spring trends as well? That's right! Velvet is truly season-less when it comes to evening wear. And [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) couldn't be happier to introduce numerous velvet fabric options.

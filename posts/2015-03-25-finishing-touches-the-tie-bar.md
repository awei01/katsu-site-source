The tie bar. A quintessential menswear accessory that is enjoying a comeback due to the resurgence of classic men's style. Although the tie bar is a small detail it has the ability to make an impact on any look.

#### **Purpose**

A tie bar is used to keep your tie fastened to your shirt placket. It seems a bit obvious, however it's important to mention since when a tie bar is attached only to your tie it is simply defeating the purpose.

#### **Styles**

 Tie bars come in two styles: pinch clasp and slide clasp. Both are great, however if you are wearing a thicker tie I would reach for a pinch clasp. It will secure your tie much better. If you are wearing a thin tie a slide clasp is the best option. One rule to remember, your tie bar should never be wider than your tie. For a classic look keep your tie and tie bar the same width.

#### **Placement**

 A good rule of thumb is to place your tie bar between your third and fourth shirt buttons. Also, never wear it at an angle. You want to look put together and wearing your tie bar at an angle will make it seem less intentional and more like an afterthought.

#### **Color**

If you want to maintain a timeless look silver is a great option. However, if you want to add a pop to an already subdued outfit opt for a color or a cool shape. The function of the tie bar remains while you are adding a modern twist.

#### **Why should I wear a tie bar?**

The tie bar is making a comeback, and if you happen to be on top of the latest trends in menswear you do not want to be without one. Not only will it help keep your tie from flying around, it will also help you stand out in a crowd. Whether you're dressed for business or a weekend out the tie bar is a great addition to any outfit.

Where to get? The possibilities are endless. While I tend to favor vintage finds in secondhand stores, you can search online for a plethora of variety in shape, color, style, metal, etc. For those of you in Boston looking for a keepsake, try the old tobacco shop, [Leavitt and Pierce](http://leavitt-peirce.com/), in Harvard Square or the outstanding [Bobby from Boston](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bobby-from-boston-boston) in the South End. Their collections of cuff links and tie pins are amazing, not to mention the hordes of other unique collectibles you can discover there. The pieces they carry are one-of-a-kind, rife with character, and a conversation piece. Others will pick up on your acute attention to detail.

Did you know we have some new tie pins on sale, right here in the studio? Step right up, gents, snag a [Tsai Clip](http://www.tsaiclip.com/) to do it right in 2013.

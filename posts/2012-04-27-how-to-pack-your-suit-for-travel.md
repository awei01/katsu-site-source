Whether you're traveling by train, plane, or automobile, there's nothing worse than scurrying to find a dry cleaner to press your suit once you've reached your final destination. While some might attempt to squeeze a suit into a suitcase to avoid that $25 stow-away fee, you should always transport your fine-looking ensemble in style. If you wear suits often, best invest in a reliable luggage carrier.

## SUIT TRANSPORTATION:

### GARMENT BAG:

First of all, you probably already have some cheap version of this (you usually get one when you buy a suit). Frequent flyers know the magical ease of the garment bag. Some people shun it as too cumbersome and a pain to carry, but this really will save you time and ironing later. Press your suit and hang in a garment bag before your departure to save yourself from wrinkle-inspired fury upon arrival. It's small enough to carry on and and lighter than a suitcase.

### SUITCASE:

I've never seen or tried this way personally, but definitely willing to give it a go my next trip. Good at origami? Check out this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQJWLU8Yvdg&feature=related) on how to fold a suit and pack it into your suitcase.

### SUIT CARRIER:

The ultimate mode of transport. Hey, if you have the loot and you want to invest in a luxury luggage item, suit carriers come in a variety of leathers, designer labels, zips, flips, and doo-dads alike.  Obviously, the most dapper gentleman will find a carrier befitting his handsome suit.

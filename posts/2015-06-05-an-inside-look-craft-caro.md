We recently got the chance to sit down with our friend Anthony Caro from Craft & Caro to learn a little more about the brand before the upcoming trunk show. The name Craft & Caro comes from a combination of the products they carry as well as Anthony's family name, Caro. All of the products at Craft & Caro are produced by authentic makers, often handmade in the USA by heritage craftsmen and women. That's how the "Craft" part came about. The "& Caro" is a nod to Anthony's own heritage of entrepreneurs, who wouldn't put their name on something unless it was something they'd be proud of. When you attach your name to something, you risk your personal reputation, so it better be nothing short of amazing. His father did so with his company, Caro Research, as did his grandfather with W.H. Hunting & Sons mills, so Anthony thought it would be appropriate to follow suit.

 _9tailors:_ What are your top three favorite Craft & Caro products?

_Anthony Caro:_ My current top three products we carry at Craft & Caro are the Small Stapler in black/gold made in Spain by El Casco, the Calfskin Cufflinks Box in Whiskey which is made in Germany by F. Hammann and the Classic Cocktail Mixer made in Vermont by Owl's Brew.

_9tailors: _Is there a story behind any of the products that you are bringing with you to the trunk show?

_AC:_ All of the products at Craft & Caro have a story of one kind or another. One of my favorites is the story behind U.S.E.D. bags and backpacks, made in Canada out of recycled seatbelts. Canada has a long history of manufacturing cars for US automakers, like Ford and Chrysler. All of the seatbelts composing these bags are from General Motors vehicles, including the buckles. Trevor Kehler, the founder of U.S.E.D., works with the Automotive Recyclers of Canada to extract the seatbelts from cars prior to shredding. Each piece is unique and they're some of the most durable bags I've encountered!

_9tailors:_ What is the best selling product on the site?

_AC:_ The best selling product on the site is Stapler 26, made in Denmark by Folle. This iconic design is included in the permanent industrial design collection at the MoMA in New York City. The manufacturer has discontinued the design until further notice, so it is becoming increasingly rare and sought after. Unfortunately, we too are out of stock. However, we've managed to work with Folle and secure a limited number of rare Stapler 26's in a variety of colors, which are coming to the site very soon, and will be included in the trunk show!!

_9tailors:_ What is the most unique product on the site?

_AC: _It's hard to choose a single most unique product on the site, but one that is particularly cool is the Brass Ashtray, made in Connecticut by a single craftsman under the brand Metal Shop. It starts as a solid block of brass, which the maker, Jon Fontane, machines into the simple but beautiful art-deco-reminiscient design of the ashtray, perfectly suited for cigars with the large half-circle rest. The inside is quartz-blasted for a matte feel, and then one of three finishes is hand applied. Brushed Brass finish looks clean and golden, while Cupric Nitrate and Ferric Nitrate leave a green-copperish and brown-rust patina, respectively. All three are unique, eye-catching, and aesthetically pleasing. And as a nod to our native Massachusetts, the bottoms are padded with leather from our neighbor Frank Clegg.

Whether you are on the hunt for the perfect Father's Day gift or in need of a few essentials for yourself Craft & Caro is sure to have exactly what you are looking for. This time next week Anthony will be hosting a Trunk Show at the 9tailors Loft, which is the perfect time to answer any questions and get a sense of everything the company has to offer.

A classic piece that _can_ make all the right impressions, the turtleneck is an item we love. Coming in all shapes and sizes, it can be worn many different ways on a spectrum from casual to formal.

**WITH SLACKS:** Throw a slim or chunky turtleneck on with a pair of slacks and, if you so choose, a blazer. It's a comfy look and feel and you'll look like a grown-up scholar.

**GO CASUAL:** Because, why not? Yeah, you could wear a t-shirt or a run-of-the-mill v-neck, but you're going to wear a turtleneck and look that much more stylish. [![SEMICASUAL]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/SEMICASUAL.jpg)]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/SEMICASUAL.jpg) 

**LAYER IT:** T-necks are great for cold weather, worn under several other layers, or you can wear one over/under one other simple layer on a chillier spring or fall day.[![LAYERS]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/LAYERS.jpg)]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/LAYERS.jpg)

**WITH A DOUBLE BREASTED SUIT:** Nothing says "in style" right now like a good double breasted suit. Throw a turtleneck on underneath and you'll be dressed to the nines without the effort.[![DOUBLEBREASTED]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/DOUBLEBREASTED.jpg)]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/DOUBLEBREASTED.jpg)

**ALL BLACK:** All black is always a classic look. Throw a black turtleneck, sleek or chunky, in with your dark ensemble and you might just turn heads with the look.[![ALLBLACK]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/ALLBLACK.jpg)]({{ site.baseUrl }}/uploads/ALLBLACK.jpg)Now that you have these basic turtleneck-wearing tactics, we expect to see a lot more dapper men out there donning turtlenecks and looking good.

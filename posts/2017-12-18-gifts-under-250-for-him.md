A cardholder is the perfect gift or those who need help keeping all of their essentials in one place. With four card slots and a central compartment for receipts or additional cards he'll be able to keep track of everything. It's also slim enough to slip right into your pocket.

Who doesn't love wireless headphones? They are super convenient and make everyday activities so much easier. No more fussing to detangle the cords of your headphones. Just pop them in your ears and go!

#### [A Watch $229](https://www.danielwellington.com/us/bundle-stmawes-glasgow)

Every guy should have a nice watch. The best part about this bundle, from [Daniel Wellington](https://www.danielwellington.com/us/), is that the straps are interchangeable. He can wear the brown leather strap to work and switch it for the nylon on the weekends.

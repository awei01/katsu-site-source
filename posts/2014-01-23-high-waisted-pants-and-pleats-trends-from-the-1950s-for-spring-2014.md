Fashion trends always repeat themselves. We've seen double breasted suits come and go and are here again along with camouflage prints in different colors and scales. [Mad Men](http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men)'s series premiere in 2007 launched a huge rival for men and women's fashion, more so for the men. Pocket squares slowly crept back into mainstream fashion after hipsters and street savvy fashionistas took hold, leading it full circle to public television with Cameron onÂ [Modern Family](http://abc.go.com/shows/modern-family%E2%80%8E). Spike Jonze's latest film, [Her](http://www.herthemovie.com/%E2%80%8E), is set in the not so distant future where the men are dressed in high-waisted pants but without the pleats from the 50's. Apparently, Spike Jonze hit the nail on its head.

Designers sent models down the runway for their Spring 2014 collections reminiscent of the 1950s casual wear, much like Spike Jonez's costumes in his movie. I'm glad the trend for men's pants are back on the rise (har-har, I apologize for the pun, kind of) and have graciously moved past the low-riding pants from the 90's, just don't go for the pleats unless your legs really need the extra space. Even Spike Jonze didn't incorporate them in his high-waisted comeback.

Little Bonus: Spike Jonez explains why he put his men in high-waisted pants. Take an extra read below.

Due to it's spectrum of great to not-so-great, we decided to give you a few tips on how to incorporate denim into your wardrobe.

**LAYERS** - Layer a jean jacket under an overcoat or even a blazer. It has great texture and will give your outfit extra style. Also try throwing a cardigan over a denim button-down for a manly look.

**BUTTON DOWN** - Throw a denim button-down on and wear it casually or formally (if done right). Paired with a navy or tweed blazer, you can't go wrong.

**ALL OR NOTHING** - If you can pull it off, go full Canadian tuxedo with it. You can wear denim of slightly different shades to break it up and pair the outfit with a pair of rugged boots or some sneakers. Beard optional.

**CHAMBRAY** - Denim stretching a little too far for you? That's okay, it has a slightly more conservative relative that has been big for a while now. You can do chambray in a shirt, light summer pants or a full suit. It's great casually or dressed up and has been making a frequent appearance in wedding parties.

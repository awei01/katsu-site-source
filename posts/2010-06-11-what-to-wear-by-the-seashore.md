Last week, we posted suggestions for what men should wear on a Cape Cod weekend trip this summer.
So, how about a post for our female readers?

9tailors offers a variety of women's shirts as well!

Not only collared shirts, but sleeveless and other styles.

Below are a few color suggestions and accessories to pair with your outfit. We suggest lightweight, cotton fabrics that are lighter colors to keep you cool. Sheer fabrics also breathe well and are perfect for a successful summer style.

Try nautical-themed accessories to match your oceanside activities for the weekend.

Or, even try a single piece, such as a necklace or sunglasses, in a bold color to add a "pop" to your wardrobe!

That's one of our shirts on CSPAN.

Well, he's former WWE wrestler, "the Scholar," and founder of the [Sports Legacy Institute](http://sportslegacy.org/). SLI focuses its research on the degenerative brain disease Chroni Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE, a condition caused by repetitive concussive and sub-concussive brain injuries. The Institute serves professional athletes, such as football players, and military veterans. To learn more about his cause, go to sportslegacy.org. It's nice to hear that our clients are doing good and looking good.

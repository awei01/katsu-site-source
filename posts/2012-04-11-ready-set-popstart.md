Calling all [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) aficionados, new and revered! We are participating in the first launching of [POPstart](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qcqpFMgp6R4/T4SRZ-iSTBI/AAAAAAAAALw/xTZchopAqqk/s320/POPStart_postcard.gif) this month. Dreamt up by a team of Harvard Business School students,  "POPstart is an exciting retail store for consumers and starts ups to celebrate and find each other. Located in the heart of Newbury Street, the store is over 2,000 square feet, offering start-ups a unique opportunity to access a large customer base." **WHEN: Saturday and Sunday, April 21-22, 11am-7pm**

We are so excited to participate in such an innovative and creative pop-up shop in the heart of Boston's trendiest area. Albeit fleeting, this opportunity affords us the chance to spread the good word about what it is we do here at [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/)! Don't forget about our [Referral Program](http://www.9tailors.com/pages/#!/pages/style_by_9tailors/referral_program) and tell your friends to visit us. If they mention your name at their initial appointment, you can both start earning credit towards your next 9tailors purchase over $100!! **FYI**: On Sunday, April 22, the 9tailors studio will be closed. However, feel free to swing by and say hello to us at 328 Newbury Street between 11am-7pm.

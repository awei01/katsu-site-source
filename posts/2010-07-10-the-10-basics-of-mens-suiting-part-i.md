How many vents do you prefer on your suit jacket? Do you know what a lapel is?
See our 10 tips below for a quick rundown on suiting basics.
\*9tailors will soon have a permanent suit collection! See details below.

1. The 2 most versatile suit colors: **Gray** and **Navy**. Either color will go with virtually any shirt and tie combination. Navy can tend to look a little more formal, while gray can be work or play appropriate.

2. Lapel: The folded flap of fabric on the front of a suit jacket or blazer. The most common lapel is the **notched** lapel. Most likely, it is what you will find on your basic suit. Other lapels include shawl and peaked, which are usually only seen on tuxedo jackets and double-breasted jackets.

3. Vents: A **vent** is the back cut(s) on the back of a suit jacket. Suits typically have none, one, or two vents. Single vent is the most common, however, double vents are common in European styles. Choose the type of vents you like based on comfort and ease of movement.

4. Buttons: How many buttons do you prefer? **2 button** jackets are the most popular, versatile jacket. 3 button jackets look more formal and are better for tall, slender figures, while 1 button jackets tend to look more casual.

5. Jacket Pockets: The number and kinds of pockets on a suit jacket can vary greatly. They can be hidden, with flaps or without, and on the left, right, or both sides.

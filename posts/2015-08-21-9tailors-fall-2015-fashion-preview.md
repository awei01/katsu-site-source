With the summer months coming to a close and fall steadily approaching us it comes as no surprise that many of us are wondering what is going to be in style this upcoming season. In preparation for the fall, we here at 9tailors have teamed up with Downeast Cider for a night full of fall fashion and handcrafted cider. Our friends over at Downeast Cider will be showcasing their line of cider with a tasting station filed with both year round and seasonal favorites.

Downeast Cider was founded by Ross Brockman and Tyler Mosher in their college dorm room at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. They wanted a hard cider that tasted like the fresh pressed apple cider that they were used to on the farm, so after 100+ test batches they developed the recipe for the beverage that became Downeast Cider. What sets them apart from the competition? Downeast cider uses all fresh pressed local apples and fresh ingredients, and they ferment their cider with an ale yeast. Downeast Cider leaves their cider unfiltered to preserve the fresh pressed apple flavor, resulting in an authentic, full bodied, crushable beverage.

Join 9tailors, [Downeast Cider](http://downeastcider.com/), sock retailer [A Man Among Socks](https://amanamongsocks.com/), beard oil company [Brothers Artisan Oil](http://www.brothersartisanoil.com/) and a few of Boston's tastemakers for a night of exclusives you wont want to miss.

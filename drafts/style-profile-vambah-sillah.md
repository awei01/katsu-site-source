## Meet Vambah

### Describe your style.

Classic modern.

### Where do you get your style inspiration?

Pinterest, magazines, and my 9Tailors stylist.

### What is your favorite 9tailors garment? Tell us why. How do you accessorize your outfit?

My favorite 9Tailors garment is the navy blue suit because of the confidence that I exude while I'm in it. I love to accessorize with my maroon wingtips and my pink checked shirt.

### What advice would you give to someone who is trying custom tailoring for the first time?

Getting custom tailored clothing is a big change for many. In many cases, they have been cast aside by name brands that they once trusted for years until the styles and sizes they came to expect were no longer being made. I would tell someone who is trying custom tailored clothing for the first time is to be patient and trust the process. It will take a while to establish a relationship with a stylist where you feel that person has your best fashion interests at heart, but when it does happen it's worth it.

### Why did you choose to shop at 9tailors?

I was one of those that had been abandoned by stores that I once trusted to fit me perfectly. I was told by a famous men's clothing store that I was too muscular for their outfits and that I needed to "stop hitting the gym."

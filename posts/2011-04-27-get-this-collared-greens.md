Colored suits have ruled the blog this week so far, but since you already know you can get any suit in any color from [9tailors](http://www.blogger.com/www.9tailors.com), here's some great accessories. Born from the mind of an mountain-man, [Collared Greens](http://www.collaredgreens.com/) is an "American Made Eco-Friendly Clothing Brand." What really caught our attention was their eye popping belts. Forget the dreary rainbow of brown these belts call up images of Candyland from years past. It's also a huge plus that these are made in the US from organic cotton. You won't have to worry about drowning the polar bears (also their icon) when you purchase from these environmentally conscious folks.

Bowties, ties, and polo shirts are the order of the day. They didn't forget the ladies either.

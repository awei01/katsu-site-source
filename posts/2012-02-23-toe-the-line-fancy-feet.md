Get formal, don't get stuffy. First, visit a black tie guide and get the nuts and bolts of this tricky area down. Then, and only then, when you are completely comfortable with the terrain, add some fun.

Some men use their cuffs to add some flavor, but that's the size of a dime. If that is your only playground you will be infinitely limited. Vests, these are for the experts: please don't go [prom](http://www.mytuxedocatalog.com/blog/new-rental-tuxedos-and-suits-for-2012/) on us. If you don't have a teen at the end of your age then these are not appropriate.

So, why don't we venture south of the pant hem. Not only are these an accessory you can enjoy yourself they are a subtle, yet still strong, way to inject your personality into an ensemble saturated in tradition.

The trick to sport these without looking like you are borrowing your favorite house slipper is the break of your pant. You should aim for a clean break of little to none to make sure there is no puddle of fabric collecting at your ankle- this is only going to accentuate the pajama look.

[Stubbs and Wooton](http://www.stubbsandwootton.com/) have an extensive collection of velvet slippers that includes the classic to the quirky. They can do custom monograms as well for added flair. Another company, [Del Toro](http://www.deltoroshoes.com/), has the same idea with a signature red stripe at the heel, like the Louboutin for men.

Get fancy. Everyone needs a little velvet in their life. Of course, if you have feet _this_ fancy you're going to need a tuxedo to match. We haven't done a leopard print, yet. Email a style consultant at [{{ site.emails.info }}](mailto:{{ site.emails.info }}) for more information- leopard optional.

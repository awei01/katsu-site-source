Meet our client turned model, Bryan, wearing a 9tailors midnight navy tuxedo (which we have a deal on at the moment, [here](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2011/10/holiday-tuxedos-anyone.html)). Towering above most at well over 6 feet custom emphasizes his height without packing on unnecessary bulk. For his look we styled two separate versions of the same suit. First, was a more formal and conservative look. This included a bowtie, understated cufflinks, a white pocket square, and standard lace-up shoes.

For the second version Bryan pulled out some of his own brightly colored cufflinks, a slim silk tie, a patterned pocket square, and a pair of buckled [Hugo Boss shoes](http://store-us.hugoboss.com/Shoes-Accessories/86666,en_US,sc.html). We left out the sometimes-stuffy waist covering and added a belt and a cocktail, his favorite accessory.

**Name** Bryan Meckley **Age** 32 **Current Occupation** Finance **Hometown** Middletown, MD **Current Residence** Boston, MA **How long have you been a 9tailors client?** One year **Why choose custom?** Personalized quality and next-level service. **What would be your style advice to other men in your professional field?** Command excellence, not extravagance. Observe. Adopt style elements from other places and eras. Fuse them in your own way. Redefine the modern gentleman. Wear it like you’re gonna be buried in it. And remember that nothing finishes a look better than a cocktail in hand. **How would you describe your style?** Classic with modern indulgences. **What/who inspires your style?** Strangers on the streets. Real men wearing real clothes in real life. The ones who get it right are worth learning from. Forget the staged magazine models – they are an impossible and irrelevant benchmark. **What is your favorite piece from 9tailors?** Midnight blue tux. Gives the vices a little class.

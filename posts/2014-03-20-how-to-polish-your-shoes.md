Today is officially the first day of Spring! The winter wardrobes (should) slowly start being put into storage and more your brighter colors and lighter weights should be coming out. Wear lighter layers in the meantime to transition from seasons and temperatures.

As for your shoes go, take care of them before you continue to wear them. The salted sidewalks has caused a lot of damage to your loved leather goods. The warm weather gives no excuse to have your shoes looking worn out and faded.

You don't want the polish to add color to your shoes, try to match it closely. Good basics to start off with are black, chestnut or dark brown and a neutral color for lighter shoes.

**Cotton Balls**

**Step One:**

The first thing you will want to do is clean your shoe. Use the welt brush to get rid of any dirt or grime built up in the welt (space where the shoe meets the sole). Use a damp cloth or the horsehair brush to get any excess dirt off the upper shoe. Your shoe must be dry before you polish it.

**Step Two:** 

Apply a generous amount of shoe polish with the dauber (applicator). Try to make it even all over the shoe and do not forget the seams and edges. Depending on how generous you are, you may need to wait 15 minutes for the polish to dry.

**Step Three:** 

Use the horsehair brush to get rid of any excess polish and create a smooth thin layer onto your shoe. Be sure to brush robustly and all over the shoe. Again, pay attention to the edges and seams.

**Step Four:** 

Wet a cotton ball and squeeze out any excess water. Dab the damp cotton ball into the shoe polish and use that to focus on extra shine for the toe of your shoe and the heel. Use circular motions. Repeat as needed to obtain desired level of shine. Use a new cotton ball each turn and remove excess polish before repeating.

**Step Five:**

Use cotton shine cloth to put finishing touches and gloss on shoe.

Now that you know what to do, I will leave you with this beautiful video of a shoe being polished (best with sound).

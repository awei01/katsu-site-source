**************Meet Dua, an incredibly talented singer and the front man for [Bad Rabbits](https://www.facebook.com/BadRabbits). We met Dua awhile back and wanted to capture his individual style, while also playing up his fun side. We ultimately settled on a double breasted jacket in a gray and purple check, then accented the pockets and lapel trim in black, accompanied with black buttons, black pants, and a light grey shirt with black buttons. The sheer joy he expressed upon trying on the jacket for the first time was priceless. Once he put the entire outfit on, we were floored. Paired with his thick black-rimmed glasses, Dua looked the epitome of geek chic.**************

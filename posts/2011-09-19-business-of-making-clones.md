Style comes in many different forms. Some relish in their ability to stand out from the crowd with outlandish, original, occasionally offensive forms of clothing. ([See Gaga](http://lady-gaga-style.blogspot.com/)) Yet others pride themselves in masterfully tailored garments in quiet hues and minimal patterns ([See James Bond](http://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/index_articles.php?m=articles&g=art081202)).

Regardless of your style orientation we can reproduce your favorite piece. Ever bought a pair of pants you fell in love with? But, once you knew the intensity of your love you returned in hopes of stocking your style arsenal with well fitting pieces only to find they were gone, never to return to the retailers of the world again. [Well, we are in the business of making clones](http://www.9tailors.com/pages/#!/pages/frequently_asked_questions/products). Bring that tattered old dress shirt that still manages to put your confidence through the roof to the studio and we will make you another. Bring in your favorite work dress so we can make one on par with its flattering shape.

Not only will you get a garment that fits like a glove, but we have thousands of fabrics to choose from so you can finally get in it every color of the rainbow.

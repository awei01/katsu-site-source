When you have an abundance of options, it can be hard to narrow down your decision OR feel confident about making the best choices. We encounter this every day as clients peruse our shirting and suiting fabrics. The overwhelming array of choices can make your head spin! As style consultants, we guide you through this jungle of colors, patterns, and weaves to lead you to the promised land of your personal/customized style.

Already have a closet full of clothes at home? No clue how how to expertly pair your ties with your shirts or what colors and patterns go together? Haven't the faintest idea how to edit your closet and figure out what's missing?

Just wanted to write up a quick reminder about all the events and activities going on at 9tailors!

First, we still have a [khaki promotion](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2011/07/and-summer-gets-better-and-better.html) going on until the end of the month. Get yourself out of that droopy, sagging, pair of parachute pants and into a finely tailored pair. You should be showing off your assets in every pair of pants you wear.

Second, if summer has officially drained your bank account we have a solution for that too. The eagerly anticipated [sample sale](http://9tailors.blogspot.com/2011/07/sample-sale-special-deals-for-our-fans.html) is here! Making killer threads available to everyone regardless of the size of their bank account has always been a goal of 9tailors. This sample sale is just another way we wanted to remind you we care.

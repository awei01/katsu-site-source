Blazers have always been a wardrobe staple. In addition to that classic navy, modern gents can now wear colorful chalky mints, bright blues and heathery grays! Don't be afraid to up your game this spring. You can wear color! Replace your tired ol' jacket and get _the_ modern blazer.

Good thing [9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) is here to help! Now through March we're offering a 20% discount on all of our spring blazers from summer-weight wools to linen.

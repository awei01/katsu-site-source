Festivus at Felt was so much fun--no lines, no cover, fun people, and free pool sponsored by 9tailors! Thanks to everyone who came out, and a special shout-out to all the new friends we met. Hi! If you missed the event, you also missed Dashing, Dapper, and Debonair\--a.k.a. Victor Wang, our marketing intern; Ernie Chin, [NAAAP Boston](http://www.naaapboston.org/) leader; and Phil Han, [Get Prept](http://getprept.com/) CEO and Festivus organizer. They're all wearing 9tailors shirts! Extra kudos to Phil, who is single-handedly bringing bowties back to Boston. Click on the photo to zoom in--it's made of a plaid fabric with skull-and-crossbones details. How wonderfully whimsical!

Here's a photo of the folks who brought it to mainstream America...

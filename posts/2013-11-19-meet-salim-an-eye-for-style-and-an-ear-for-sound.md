**************Meet Salim, a spirited and friendly young man who has an eye for style and an ear for sound. When this musician visited the**************[9tailors](http://www.9tailors.com/) studio, he expressed he was looking for something funky, without being too over the top. We settled on black and a gray subtle check fabric, mixing the two to achieve a color balance, and also introduced some bright orange accessories (courtesy of the exquisite collection offered by [Salmagundi](http://salmagundiboston.com/)) that popped against the darker palette. The three piece design coincided with the inspiration of Don Cheadle's character, Marty Kaan on _House of Lies_. The finishing touches clicked and Salim OWNED this debonair look.  

**Age:** 31

**Hometown:** Walpole, MA 

**Current residence**: Boston, MA

**Occupation:** Musician, DJ and Audio Engineer

**How long have you been a 9tailors client?**  "Eight months."

**Why choose custom?**

"The experience of buying a suit from a mass retailer has always left me settling for a style or cut that isn't 100% what I wanted. Having a suit custom made allows you to choose and mix the latest styles but if you have an oddly shaped body you have the flexibility to literally tailor it to the exact measurements of your body!"

**What/who inspires your style? Why? **

"Pharrell Williams, Don Cheadle and Ari Gold. They all have a bold sense of style but it's classy and clean."

**What is your favorite piece from 9tailors? **

"The whole suit itself, I can't choose one piece!" **How difficult is it to find garments that targets your specific needs and style?**

"As I mentioned previously, for me it's very difficult. I always end up settling for something that's not exactly what I wanted."

**What would be your style advice to other men in your professional field? **

"Think outside the box and be bold, but clean!"

_We hear that! The trick to accessorizing is all about balancing the look and keeping it clean and sharp._ See photos of Salim below, taken by our esteemed and amazing photographer, [Channing Johnson](http://www.channingjohnson.com/).

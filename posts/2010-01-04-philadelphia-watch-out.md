Details on the presentation:

Wharton Retail Club is proud to present: "Dressing for Success: How one young entrepreneur created a fashion business in a tough economy."

It's a tough out there. Rising costs. Growing consumer demands. Every business faces a multitude of issues, particularly in a tough economy. Come hear how the founder and CEO of 9tailors, Samantha Shih, tackled these challenges and created her own online fashion business.

[9tailors](http://9tailors.com) is the premier online custom e-taiilor that serves as the primary avenue for men and women in search of affordable, stylish clothing. 9tailors has revolutionized the business of custom dress shirt making by bringing the design tool online. The company values goods that are not mass-produced; each shirt is made-to-order. With over 1,134,000 unique looks, 9tailors shoppers know that they have designed something that is truly their own.

As a young professional working at a major management consulting firm, Samantha found it difficult to find clothing that fit her body type, style and budget. In 2007, Samantha set out to create a company that addressed these exact needs. Follow her story as she explains how she went from idea conception through product development and finally, to company launch.

Samantha has been featured in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/technology/companies/27polyvore.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=polyvore&st=cse), [Boston Globe](http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2009/08/02/mass_start_ups_take_another_run_at_custom_made_apparel/) and [Boldfacers](http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page=profile&profile_id=179). 9tailors was named one of the "Best of the New" shops in Boston by Boston Globe Magazine in 2008. She is a graduate of Brown University.

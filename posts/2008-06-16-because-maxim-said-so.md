About a month ago, I started receiving [Maxim Magazine](http://www.maxim.com/index.aspx) in my mailbox. I was a little surprised since I did not actually purchase a subscription (neither had Austin). Nevertheless, I have been entertaining myself with the photos and humorous reads on gadgets, games, girls and guy's version of celeb gossip (for instance, the latest on [Jessica Alba](http://jessicaalba.net/) and the internet rumor about about a possible appearance of [Kimbo Slice](http://www.kimboslice.org/) on [UFC](http://www.ufc.com/)).

It appears (as featured on page 102 of the July issue) that bespoke has entered mainstream. In the article, _How to Buy_ _\- bespoke everything_, Maxim writes, "While a made-from scratch shirt ain't cheap ($120 to $600), it's worth it. 'You'll have exact fit and no excess fabric at the waist,' says Quinn (Duncun Quinn of Duncun Quinn haberdashery).'" Ahh, yes. Wise words.

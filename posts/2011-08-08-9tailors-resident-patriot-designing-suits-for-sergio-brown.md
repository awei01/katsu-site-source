Never a dull moment in the [9tailors](http://9tailors.com/) studio and this weekend was no different. Not only was the studio abuzz with sample sale appointments we also had the pleasure of designing a three piece suit for a newly signed [Patriots](http://www.patriots.com/index.html) player. Officially added to the 53 man roster on October 23, 2010, [Sergio Brown](http://archive.patriots.com/team/index.cfm?ac=playerbio&bio=34194) made some time, despite the grueling training, to come into the studio and design a suit for some upcoming events.

Guided by his personal style consultant, Sergio sifted through hundreds of fabrics before making his decision. After choosing the fabric and style options he was measured to ensure a proper fit.

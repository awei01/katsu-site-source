You've celebrated the last vestiges of summer this past weekend. We're now eagerly awaiting for the new season to begin. It's almost time to pack up your shorts and polos. But, what do you need for fall 2014? Here are the top five tips you should be paying attention to.

**Fall Tip #1: Brown and Green**

These were the two primary colors for fall 2014. The somber look of these two colors provides a refreshing contrast to last season's brights blues. We recommend trying a suit or suit separate in mocha brown or olive green.

**Fall Tip #2: Texture**

We love layering various textures together! It adds visual interest and depth to any outfit. We recommend trying pairing a tweed jacket with a knit-wool tie. Or, you can wear your chunky knit sweater over your chambray shirt. The possibilities are endless.

**Fall Tip #3: Tonal**

Try monochromatic this fall from head to toe. We're particularly partial to tonal grays and taupe for a sophisticated look. But, extra points are given to those who can pull off all white!

**Fall Tip #4: The dress boot**

This trend carried over from last year. But, we still love the way the dress boot falls under a narrow trouser leg or a cuffed jeans. Go with laces or monk straps. Either are sure to be a great investment for the fall and winter.

**Fall Tip #5: Military**

This fall is all about the masculine and the rugged. We're seeing military influences everywhere from over-sized coats to bomber jackets. How about adding gun flap to your outerwear or epaulets to your shirt? We recommend trying fitted dress pants with cargo pockets in textured tweed or suiting wool.

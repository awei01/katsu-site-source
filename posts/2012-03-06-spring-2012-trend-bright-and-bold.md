Spring is fast approaching-some may even consider the season already upon us as the wintry months turned out um…_not_ so wintry (by new England standards). Regardless, as temperatures rise, it’s time to think about brightening up your wardrobe.

Vibrant maritime and royal blues as well as marigold yellows dotted the runways debuting Spring 2012 menswear collections. Read: bright colors are in! However, doing bright right is immensely important. You don't want to blind people with too much dazzle, nor do you want to mute down a vibrant hue and take away its luster. Never fear, we have some helpful tips for you! We've selected a 9tailors checked favorite below.

Checked patterns are very versatile and you can wear them both casually or in a professional setting, when done correctly.  For a more casual look, if your shirt has a louder color like yellow, simply accentuate it with complimentary, downplayed colors in your other garments to make the shirt stand out more.

Try toning down a brighter, checked pattern with a solid dark suit, like navy blue. Go a step further and venture out of your comfort zone, play up the preppy with a lighter color for your accessories, like baby blue for a pocket square or tie.
